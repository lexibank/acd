There are, however, also many exceptions to this rule ... a. when added to a noun derived from a verb or adjective _-a_ denotes the place or time in which the action takes place or the condition in question prevails; this suffix also occurs with forms that are prefixed with _ka-_ and a possessive pronoun; b. _-a_ is added to (underived) nouns in the sense 'having, supplied with, suffering from.
