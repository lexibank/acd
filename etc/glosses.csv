Toba_Batak,-an,"(in the second passive) the prefix <span class=""wd"">tar-</span> or <span class=""wd"">ha-</span> is placed before the nominal form.

The passive verbal substantives with the suffix <span class=""wd"">-an</span> do not always have a corresponding verb with the suffix <span class=""wd"">-i</span>.

'that which has been eaten into (by a disease)' (referring to marks left on the limbs by, for example, an eruptive skin disease... Such derived substantives represent a place where that which the verb represents usually takes place, or must take place... The suffix <span class=""wd"">-an</span>, just as the suffix <span class=""wd"">-i</span>, can, moreover, not only refer to a plural, but also <i>to the repeated occurrence</i> of the thing represented by the verb, or to <i>its occurring on and off</i>, for example, <span class=""wd"">dalan-an</span> can also mean <i>where it is customary for someone to walk</i>... The suffix <span class=""wd"">-an</span> seldom denotes a direct object, but an example is <span class=""wd"">suru-an</span> 'messenger who is sent', from <span class=""wd"">ma-nuru</span>.  <span class=""wd"">Suru-suru-an</span> (repetition of the stem-word) is, however, far more often found...where such a word has not been taken from <span class=""lg"">Minangkabau</span> or <span class=""lg"">Malay</span> <span class=""wd"">-an</span>, representing <span class=""wd"">-i</span>, also means a plural, or repetition, or frequency ... (The second kind of nominal verb) has the suffix <span class=""wd"">-an</span>. a. When verbs of this kind are derived from substantives, the suffix indicates <i>place</i> and the subject is, therefore, represented by this verb as being a place where what the stem-word means can be seen (e.g. <span class=""wd"">panas-an</span> 'to sweat' = the place where the sweat (<span class=""wd"">panas</span>) is; <span class=""wd"">roŋit-an</span> 'to be bothered by flies' = something where flies (<span class=""wd"">roŋit</span>) are to be found), b. when this kind of nominal verb is derived from a verb, the subject is other than the stem-word, i.e. a person who is affected by what the stem-word represents (e.g. <span class=""wd"">ŋolŋol-an</span> 'be bored' : <span class=""wd"">ŋolŋol</span> 'boring', c. the suffix further strengthens what is represented by the stem-word and the derived form then means 'taking place continually', or 'occurring extensively' (e.g. <span class=""wd"">borat-an</span> 'be very laden' : <span class=""wd"">borat</span> 'heavy'; d. these verbs also mean 'an acquiring of', or 'a losing of', as a state (e.g. <span class=""wd"">mate-an</span> 'having deaths, of someone whose soldiers have been slain'; e. when they are derived from a qualificative verb, these verbs have the accent on the suffix and indicate that the quality exists to a greater degree (e.g. <span class=""wd"">gabe-án</span> 'to be richer' : <span class=""wd"">gabé</span> 'rich', <span class=""wd"">datu-án</span> 'to be a more skillful <span class=""wd"">datu</span>' ... Words ending in a vowel can insert an <span class=""wd"">n</span> before the suffix (e.g. <span class=""wd"">dae-n-an</span>, from <span class=""wd"">dae</span>) (<span class=""bib""><a class=""bib"" href=""acd-bib.htm#van"">van der Tuuk 1971:161, 196ff</a></span>)","(in the second passive) the prefix _tar-_ or _ha-_ is placed before the nominal form. The prefix _ha_ is always used when the active has the suffix _-i_: in the passive, this suffix is replaced by _-an_... The passive verbal substantives with the suffix _-an_ do not always have a corresponding verb with the suffix _-i_. Their meaning can also be derived from another verbal form. For example, I have never come across a _ma-maŋani-_, which would mean 'to eat out of (something), as an active corresponding to _paŋan-an_: 1. 'that which can be eaten out of' (e.g. a large leaf); 2. 'from which one usually eats (a plate or a dish); 3. 'that which has been eaten into (by a disease)' (referring to marks left on the limbs by, for example, an eruptive skin disease... Such derived substantives represent a place where that which the verb represents usually takes place, or must take place... The suffix _-an_, just as the suffix _-i_, can, moreover, not only refer to a plural, but also _to the repeated occurrence_ of the thing represented by the verb, or to _its occurring on and off_, for example, _dalan-an_ can also mean _where it is customary for someone to walk_... The suffix _-an_ seldom denotes a direct object, but an example is _suru-an_ 'messenger who is sent', from _ma-nuru_. _Suru-suru-an_ (repetition of the stem-word) is, however, far more often found...where such a word has not been taken from [Minangkabau](LanguageTable#cldf:)","vandertuuk1971[161, 196ff]",427-b39665e573a6aa3307d2e16bbfb4ede0-1

Such nouns, derived from verbs by the addition of _-an_, refer to a collection of items, when the root is reduplicated (e.g. _meŋ-gali_ 'to dig' : _gali-an_ 'what is dug up' : _gali-gali-an_ 'minerals, root crops', _tembak_ 'to shoot' : _tembak-an_ 'shot' : _tembak-tembak-an_ 'shooting'; 7. Just as the suffix _-an_, added to a reduplicated noun root, produces a noun referring to a collection of items, the same suffix, added to a few adjective roots, usually reduplicated, produces a noun referring to a collection of items which can be characterized by that adjective (e.g. _enak_ 'delicious' : _enak-enak-an_ 'delicacies', _manis_ 'sweet' : _manis-an_ 'candy, sweets'; 8. Otherwise, adjectives and the occasional verb root, when reduplicated and followed by _-an_, produce adjectives, or adverbs of manner (e.g. _teraŋ_ 'bright' : _teraŋ-teraŋ-an_ 'frank', _takut_ 'afraid' : _takut-takut-an_ 'bashful', _buta_ 'blind' : _buta-buta-an_ 'at random, blindly') ([Macdonald and Soenjono 1967:65ff](Source#cldf:macdonaldanddarjowidjojo1967)).",macdonaldanddarjowidjojo1967[65ff],240-ebdf0d44afbd324e4ec340c243370db3-1
