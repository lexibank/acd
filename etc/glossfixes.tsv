When verbs of this kind are derived from substantives, the suffix indicates <i>place</i> and the subject is, therefore, represented by this verb as being a place where what the stem-word means can be seen (e.g. <span class=""wd"">panas-an</span> 'to sweat' = the place where the sweat (<span class=""wd"">panas</span>) is; <span class=""wd"">roŋit-an</span> 'to be bothered by flies' = something where flies (<span class=""wd"">roŋit</span>) are to be found), b. when this kind of nominal verb is derived from a verb, the subject is other than the stem-word, i.e. a person who is affected by what the stem-word represents (e.g. <span class=""wd"">ŋolŋol-an</span> 'be bored' : <span class=""wd"">ŋolŋol</span> 'boring', c. the suffix further strengthens what is represented by the stem-word and the derived form then means 'taking place continually', or 'occurring extensively' (e.g. <span class=""wd"">borat-an</span> 'be very laden' : <span class=""wd"">borat</span> 'heavy'; d. these verbs also mean 'an acquiring of', or 'a losing of', as a state (e.g. <span class=""wd"">mate-an</span> 'having deaths, of someone whose soldiers have been slain'; e. when they are derived from a qualificative verb, these verbs have the accent on the suffix and indicate that the quality exists to a greater degree (e.g. <span class=""wd"">gabe-án</span> 'to be richer' : <span class=""wd"">gabé</span> 'rich', <span class=""wd"">datu-án</span> 'to be a more skillful <span class=""wd"">datu</span>' ... Words ending in a vowel can insert an <span class=""wd"">n</span> before the suffix (e.g. <span class=""wd"">dae-n-an</span>, from <span class=""wd"">dae</span>) (<span class=""bib""><a class=""bib"" href=""acd-bib.htm#van"">van der Tuuk 1971:161, 196ff</a></span>)"

24851	Banggai	-an	wd	"suffix forming adjectives.  The suffix <span class=""wd"">-an</span> is actually local, and in the second instance temporal, and it thus gives the place and time at which or in which the meaning of the stem word is realized...

There are, however, also many exceptions to this rule ... a. when added to a noun derived from a verb or adjective <span class=""wd"">-a</span> denotes the place or time in which the action takes place or the condition in question prevails; this suffix also occurs with forms that are prefixed with <span class=""wd"">ka-</span> and a possessive pronoun; b. <span class=""wd"">-a</span> is added to (underived) nouns in the sense 'having, supplied with, suffering from.
