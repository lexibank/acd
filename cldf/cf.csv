Throughout much of eastern Indonesia the word appears to have been borrowed through the mediation of [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), and the same may be true of [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573) _arak_, although [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) _árak_ is another plausible source.

This term is defined more by the process of distillation, which marks it off from native forms of brewing liquors by simple fermentation, than by any distinctive ingredient. Its wide distribution and integration into the morphological system of some languages shows how easily loanwords can take on the characteristics of native forms. Somewhat ironically, [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660) _arak_ must have been borrowed during the earliest period of Islamization, as it is one of the few Arabic loans in the [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660) material.",,*arak

Collins, that the pre-European spice trade of Indonesia was mediated by Brunei Malays in a commercial arc that linked Brunei (and peninsular Malay ports) with the southern Philippines and northern Moluccas. The maintenance of such contacts on a regular basis would have required sailing along the western and northern coasts of Sabah, through the Sulu Archipelago to southern Mindanao, and from there to Sangir-Talaud and northern Sulawesi before reaching the northern Moluccas. Given this interpretation the otherwise puzzling occurrence of apparent Philippine loanwords in Buli of southern Halmahera can be placed within a coherent historical context. There can be little doubt that the same network served the propagation of Islam. 

Although some form of spice trade between eastern and western Indonesia (and points beyond) probably predated the arrival of Islam in island Southeast Asia by many centuries, there is little evidence for large-scale trade contacts with eastern Indonesia during the Indianization of western Indonesia (e.g. the Sriwijaya period). On present evidence, then, it appears most likely that a regular and systematic linkage of Moluccan clove and nutmeg suppliers with Bruneian or other Malay distributors developed in concert with the diffusion of Islam into Borneo, the southern Philippines and the northern Moluccas during the 14th and 15th centuries. If so, the Brunei of Pigafetta, with its lavish displays of wealth and rank, must have been a relatively nouveau-riche Islamic elaboration upon an older Indianized state in which the supporting trade base had only recently undergone a fundamental shift from a western Indonesian to an eastern Indonesian emphasis.",,

At the same time the occurrence of reflexes in [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432) and [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660)  indicates that diffusion of the term (and the associated practice of domesticating ducks) must have begun by the 7th century A.D.

This is one of the few cases in which a [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) loanword appears to have reached Taiwan, but given the practical value of the animal and the likelihood that diffusion to Taiwan took place directly from the Philippines a hypothesis of borrowing is not at all unlikely.

Once they are alone she turns and flees with a hideous shriek, revealing a hole through the middle of her back, her feet not quite touching the earth. 

The forms cited here are conspicuous for their multiple phonological irregularities and apparent morphological reanalyses. This strongly suggests that the form has been borrowed, probably from [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326). According to Alton L. Becker (p.c.) a similar folk belief is found in Burma. If true it is tempting to hypothesize that the _puntianak_ belief was ultimately borrowed by speakers of an early form of [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) from a mainland Southeast Asian source and subsequently disseminated through much of island Southeast Asia.

The problem with this hypothesis is that a similar belief is found among speakers of [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) languages. For [Nggela](LanguageTable#cldf:359) in the central Solomons [Fox, C.

For reasons that are unclear, the [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) or [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285) name of this belief was widely borrowed during a much more recent period of history, overlaying an older cultural distribution and presumably replacing the older name in most areas.",,

The origin of the term in the languages of Sulawesi, however, remains unclear. The forms in [Minangkabau](LanguageTable#cldf:337) and [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) suggest that this word, like the similar term for 'duck', is onomatopoetic. An independent term for 'goat' (&ast;_kandiŋ_) is found in a number of the languages of Borneo and the Philippines, but the domestication of goats is certainly of secondary origin in island Southeast Asia.

The tomato would then most likely have made its landfall in the Philippines in one of the returning galleons that brought its cargo into Manila Bay, where the native population was [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423)-speaking.  Presumably the name was misheard and bruited about in the form _kamátis_, in which form it eventually spread throughout the Philippines, but not beyond (note that [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573), spoken in Guam, which was a regular galleon stopover, does not show this sporadic change).  


The [Tetun](LanguageTable#cldf:1060) word almost certainly derives from Portuguese, and the same may be true of the word in various languages of Sulawesi.  By contrast, the [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326)/Indonesian word appears to derive from Dutch _tomaat_, itself a loanword from Spanish or Portuguese.  Needless to say, the sporadic prenasalization in Western Bukidnon Manobo, SUBAN, [Mapun](LanguageTable#cldf:19176) and [Tiruray](LanguageTable#cldf:433) is part of a much larger phenomenon of ‘pandemic irregularity’ characteristic of sound change in hundreds of the languages in insular Southeast Asia ([Blust 1996a](Source#cldf:blust1996)).",,

The plant is native to Southeast Asia, but variants of the names _duku_ and _laŋsat_ (cf. [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326)) are found in Thai and Burmese, as well as Austronesian languages.  This leaves little doubt that it is a loanword, but the source remains unknown.

30194,trivet,,loan,"Given its meaning one would not expect this to be a loan distribution.  However, three independent pieces of evidence show that the words in [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423), [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577), [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432) and [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285) are almost certainly [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) loans.  First, [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) shows _-_Ɂ corresponding to [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) final vowel.  Second, the word is unknown in any language of the Philippines apart from [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423). Third, [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_dalikan_ is a far better candidate for the meaning ‘trivet, three stones of the hearth’.  
[Zorc (1996)](Source#cldf:zorc1996) took the correspondence of final glottal stop in [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) to final glottal stop in [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276) to be evidence for &ast;_-Ɂ_, and so presumably would posit &ast;_tuŋkuɁ_. However, as shown in [Blust (2013; sect. 8.2.2.4)](Source#cldf:blust2013), there are serious problems with the proposal that &ast;_-Ɂ_ existed in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072), [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081), or any early Austronesian proto-language.  

The agreement between [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276) and [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) in this case appears instead to be entirely fortuitous: [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276) added _-Ɂ_ to many words that originally ended in a vowel (or, in some cases a -VC sequence that first monophthongized), and [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) acquired a final glottal stop in loanwords from [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) (mostly Brunei Malay).  Many [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) loanwords entered the Philippines through a trading colony in Manila Bay, where [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) was spoken natively ([Wolff 1976](Source#cldf:wolff1976)), and in the present case this loan evidently got no further.  

Finally, &ast;dalikan ‘trivet’ is unquestionably native, and is found from the Batanes islands, to northern Sumatra, to southern Sulawesi, to the Mariana islands, to Timor in the Lesser Sundas, showing that a better candidate exists for this meaning.  A loanword of this kind suggests that [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) contact with the Philippines was rather intimate rather than distant.

This Sanskrit loanword entered [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) and [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660) during the Indianization of western Indonesia.  It was later spread to the Philippines through Malay traders, who probably concentrated their efforts mostly in the [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423)-speaking region of Manila Bay.  From [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) it reached areas of the northern Philippines that apparently never came under direct [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) contact influence.  Given his usual practice of including pseudo-reconstructions for loanwords with a distribution that would justify an attribution to his ‘Proto-Indonesian’ if they were native, it is noteworthy that [Dempwolff (1938)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) did not include this form.  The reason for this exclusion may have been phonotactic, since a reconstruction &ast;_saksi_ would violate his otherwise exceptionless template of CVCVC forms or CVCCVC forms which were either reduplicated monosyllables or unreduplicated bases with homorganic medial prenasalization.  Finally, the extent to which this form has been integrated into native morphological paradigms is a warning that loanwords cannot easily be detected by their exclusion from indigenous word-building mechanisms.",,

[Dempwolff (1938)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) reconstructed &ast;_surat_ ‘writing’, and [Blust (1976:33)](Source#cldf:blust1976) noted that “Since all reported ‘indigenous’ scripts in Indonesia and the Philippines ... appear to be based on Indian originals, there is no known physical reason to suppose a pre-Indian tradition of ‘bamboo literacy’.  &ast;_surat_ is not a Sanskrit loanword, however, invariably and exclusively refers to writing, and must have existed in western Indonesia only slightly later than the earliest inscriptions in an Indian-based script.  It therefore seems unlikely that writing was introduced to Indonesia entirely as a result of direct or stimulus diffusion from India.”  

Whatever the origin of this word, it now seems safest to assume that it came to refer to writing in the Malay world only after the introduction of Indic scripts.  What is most remarkable is its occurrence (with irregular sound correspondences) in several Formosan languages, presumably as a result of the Dutch commericial and proselytizing presence in southwest Taiwan from 1624-1661.  Since the short-lived Dutch colonization of Taiwan was staged from Batavia it is very likely that it would have included [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) speakers, and one can only assume in the absence of direct historical evidence that some of these Malays introduced elements of literacy to the Siraya.  However, the historical records we have indicate that the earliest Dutch contact with Taiwan in October, 1623, was a fleet under the command of Cornelis Reyerson that included “a small following of soldiers and Bandanese slaves”, but apparently no Malays ([Blusse and Roessingh 1984:66](bib-Blusse)).  Nonetheless, the observations that were made of the Siraya-speaking Soulang village claim that the population at that time already used “many [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) words”.  While this can be interpreted as meaning only that the Dutch recognized [Siraya](LanguageTable#cldf:416) cognates of [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) words they already knew -- much as they did two decades earlier in stating that there was “much of [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) in [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432)” -- several cited forms are distinctively [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), and not [Siraya](LanguageTable#cldf:416), as with _babij_ ‘pig’, _tacot_ ‘afraid’, _boesoek_ ‘rotten’, _maccan_ ‘to eat’, or _ican_ ‘fish’.  Some of the Dutch in this contingent speculated that these words might have been introduced by Malay sailors from Johore who had preceded them in reaching southwest Taiwan, but this raises the question why similar contacts would not have happened along the west coast of northern Luzon.  The presence of _sulal_ in [Kavalan](LanguageTable#cldf:293) is more plausibly attributed to contact with [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) speakers who accompanied the Spanish during their even briefer colonization of northeast Taiwan from 1626-1642.  

Finally, the forms in some of the languages of Sulawesi, as [Bare'e](LanguageTable#cldf:236) and [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947) suggest that [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _surat_ may have arisen from [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) &ast;_suRat_ ‘to carve, incise’, and spread widely during the apogee of Sriwijaya after undergoing semantic change.

[Dempwolff (1938)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) proposed an etymological chimera, comparing the western Indonesian forms with [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _túlis_ ‘point, sharp end; spire;; anything tapering and pointed’, which is better assigned to [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) &ast;_tirus_ ‘tapering, attenuating to a point’, and with [Samoan](LanguageTable#cldf:401) _tusi_ ‘point (with finger); draw; write’, etc., and other Polynesian forms that are best assigned to [PCEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19074) &ast;_tusi_ ‘draw, make marks or designs’.",,
