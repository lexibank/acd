24941,*a₁,a,article,"The history of this morpheme is problematic.  In the Solomons and in Central Pacific languages reflexes of &ast;_a_ function as a personal article, in contrast to the common noun article &ast;_na_.  [Pawley (1972:58)](Source#cldf:pawley1972) reconstructs ""PEOc"" &ast;_na_/_a_ ‘common article’, and &ast;_(q)a_ ‘personal article’, thus positing a rather dubious distinction between contrasting articles &ast;_a_ and &ast;_(q)a_.  Similarly, [Walsh and Biggs (1966)](Source#cldf:walshandbiggs1966) posit PPn &ast;_ʔa_ ‘personal article’, but reconstruct &ast;_ʔ-_ purely on the basis of [Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434) _ʔa-_. Since [Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434) is known to have added initial glottal stop in the reflexes of some other grammatical morphemes ([Clark 1976](Source#cldf:clark1976)) the evidence for distinguishing &ast;_a_ ‘common article’ and &ast;_qa_ ‘personal article’ appears to be dangerously thin.  This morpheme may be a sporadic shortening of &ast;_na_ which happened independently in a number of [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) languages.  If so, however, it is puzzling that it often replaced &ast;_i_ as a personal article rather than continuing to function as a common noun article.",pawley1972[58];walshandbiggs1966;clark1976

I assume ultimate stress, since the genitive marker &ast;_ni_ is the non-contrastive element in genitive constructions.

Together with [Atayal](LanguageTable#cldf:493) _aba_ these facts suggest that this cognate set is more likely to be a native form than a loan. 



Finally, although [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _abaŋ_ ‘elder brother’ could be analyzed as _aba-ŋ_ (with fossilized vocative suffix), and hence compared with the other forms cited here, I prefer to treat it as distinct and to withdraw the etymon &ast;_ab(ae)ŋ_ ‘elder brother’ proposed in [Blust (1970)](Source#cldf:blust1970).",anceaux1987;wilkinson1959;blust1970

Although non-[Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) witnesses point consistently to &ast;_atas_ (with metathesis of the first vowel and consonant in [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:19083)) the reconstruction of a [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) etymon is more problematic.  [Tsuchida (1983)](Source#cldf:tsuchida1983) identifies the [Puyuma](LanguageTable#cldf:386) stem as _-Tas_, since e.g. _i-Tas_ ‘up, above’ lacks an initial stem vowel.  If this analysis is adopted, however, comparison of the [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) and extra-[Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) material becomes difficult.  


To explain the missing initial vowel in [Puyuma](LanguageTable#cldf:386) _-Tas_ we might posit a stem &ast;_Caqas_ which is prefixed both in [Puyuma (Tamalakaw)](LanguageTable#cldf:18964) _a-Tas_ ‘high’, and in all [MP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) languages.  This hypothesis offers the minor advantage of deriving the Central Philippine forms without metathesis, but creates two more serious problems: 1) it forces us to assume an irregular loss of _-H-_ with contraction of the resulting vowel sequence in [Puyuma](LanguageTable#cldf:386), and 2) it forces us to assume that all non-[Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) reflexes outside the central Philippines contain an independently reconstructible prefix or particle (presumably &ast;_qa_ ‘locative particle’) which has become fossilized.  While this analysis may work for most reflexes in [MP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) languages, it is not clear that the initial vowel in [Puyuma (Tamalakaw)](LanguageTable#cldf:18964) _a-Tas_ ‘high’ has any connection with &ast;_Sa_; the same must be said for the morphologically corresponding but probably convergent form [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) _ha-taʔás_ ‘very long; high’.  As a compromise, then, I assume that [Puyuma (Tamalakaw)](LanguageTable#cldf:18964) _-Tas_ shows an irregular loss of the first syllable vowel.  Finally, [Ross (1988:276)](Source#cldf:ross1988) reconstructs [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_qatas_ ‘summit, top’, but provides no supporting evidence for the initial consonant.",tsuchida1983;ross1988[276]
24773,*aCay,a,death,"Also [Bontok](LanguageTable#cldf:246) _etéy_ ‘death’, _pátay_ ‘any sacrifice performed on behalf of the village’, [Aklanon](LanguageTable#cldf:226) _ka-mátay-on_ ‘death’, [Manggarai](LanguageTable#cldf:816) _mate_ ‘the late, the deceased’, [Ngadha](LanguageTable#cldf:357) _mate_ ‘die; dead; the deceased; kill, slay’, [Lamaholot](LanguageTable#cldf:19031) _maté-n_ ‘already dead, not moving any more’, [Fordata](LanguageTable#cldf:18184) _matta_ ‘die; dead; go out (fire, light)’, [Kowiai/Koiwai](LanguageTable#cldf:304) _matata_ ‘corpse’, [Marshallese](LanguageTable#cldf:833) _mij_ ‘dead; numb; death’, [Niue](LanguageTable#cldf:362) _mase_ ‘die’.  Since all of the forms that Dempwolff compared contain a reflex either of &ast;_p-_ or of &ast;_m-_, he reconstructed both &ast;_patay_ and &ast;_matay_ ‘die, dead’. However, rather than list these reconstructions with the relevant supporting evidence separately, as was his practice with doublets, he posited paired etyma &ast;_patay_, &ast;_matay_ at the head of a single mixed comparison, with an empty cross-reference to &ast;_matay_.  The explanation for this treatment is given in [Dempwolff (1934-38:sect. 47e)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438), where it is suggested that &ast;_matay_ is derived from &ast;_patay_ by nasal substitution, but is sufficiently widespread (being found in ‘Indonesian’, ‘Melanesian’ and Polynesian languages) to require a separate reconstruction.  This was perhaps the closest Dempwolff came to the reconstruction of morphology. 


The evidence now available shows that the unaffixed [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) base in question was &ast;_aCay_.  Dempwolff's &ast;_patay_ and &ast;_matay_ can most convincingly be derived from &ast;_pa-aCay_ ‘kill’  (with causative &ast;_pa-_) and &ast;_ma-aCay_ ‘dead’ (with stative &ast;_ma-_).  That the base began with a vowel rather than &ast;_q-_ is clear from such reflexes as [Bunun](LanguageTable#cldf:250) _atađ_ ‘kill’, [Kalamian Tagbanwa](LanguageTable#cldf:18285) _patay_ ‘dead’, [Moken](LanguageTable#cldf:341) _matay_ ‘die; dead’, [Muna](LanguageTable#cldf:350) _mate_ ‘die; dead’, [Lou](LanguageTable#cldf:322) _mat_ ‘die; dead’, and [Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434) _mate_ ‘die; dead’.  The merger of &ast;_q-_ and zero in many attested languages would have led to homophony between reflexes of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_aCay_ ‘death’ and &ast;_qaCay_ ‘liver’, both of which figured in numerous expressions relating to the emotions.  Possibly to avoid such potentially awkward homophony the unaffixed base was lost in the great majority of languages, leaving reflexes of &ast;_pa-aCay_ and &ast;_ma-aCay_ as effective secondary base forms for further morphological elaboration.  Thus, next to [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_pa-aCay_ and [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_pa-atay_ ‘kill’ there is a priori evidence for e.g. [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_pa(ka)-m-atay_ ‘kill’ and [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) &ast;_ka-m-atay-an_ ‘affected by a death’, where the outer affixation evidently was added to an already prefixed base.  


The alternative hypothesis, that forms such as [Bunun](LanguageTable#cldf:250) _atađ_ ‘kill’, [Casiguran Dumagat](LanguageTable#cldf:569) _atë_ ‘die; dead; death’ or [Kelabit](LanguageTable#cldf:299) _ate_ are products of analogical back-formation from a base &ast;_paCay_ or &ast;_maCay_ is more difficult to maintain in view of the fairly clear (though by no means universal) association of reflexes of the former with the causative ‘kill’ and of reflexes of the latter with the stative ‘dead’. Partly by analogy with &ast;_ma-qudip_ ‘living, alive’, I have attributed all reflexes that Dempwolff would have assigned to &ast;_matay_ to [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_ma-aCay_, [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_ma-atay_, [PCEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19074) &ast;_matay_, [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_mate_.  It is possible that these forms actually represent a conflation of &ast;_ma-aCay_ ‘dead’ (stative) and &ast;_um-aCay_ ‘die’ (active), since the initial vowel in reflexes of  &ast;_in-atay_ generally disappeared even though it was retained in most other forms, and we would expect a parallel treatment of the initial vowel of &ast;_um-atay_.  Nonetheless, pairs such as [Kelabit](LanguageTable#cldf:299) _mate_ ‘die; dead’, _in-ate_ ‘killed’ suggest that the former does contain a reflex of &ast;_ma-_ rather than &ast;_um-_.  The same apparently must be assumed in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_m-in-atay_ ‘person who has died, corpse’ (= &ast;_m-in-a-atay_, with contraction of the sequence of like vowels), despite the fact that the co-occurrence of &ast;_ma-_ ‘stative’ and &ast;_-in-_ ‘perfective’ is otherwise rare.  


Because of occasional ambiguities in the morphology it is possible that I have posited some morphologically complex forms of &ast;_aCay_ and its reflexes which are in reality products of convergent innovation.  Examples include &ast;_m-atay-an_ ‘lose someone through death’, &ast;_paŋ-m-atay_ ‘means of killing(?)’, &ast;_ka-p-atay-an_ ‘end of death of something(?)’ and &ast;_ka-p-atay-en_ ‘death(?)’.  As implied in passing above, it appears likely that the prefix of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_ma-aCay_ was reinterpreted as part of the stem in [PCEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19074) &ast;_matay_.  The only known counterevidence to this claim is [Bimanese](LanguageTable#cldf:241) _h-ade_ ‘kill, extinguish a fire’ and [Soboyo](LanguageTable#cldf:419) _n-ate_ ‘2sg, 3sg and 3pl form of _m-ate_ ‘die’. Finally, although Dempwolff reconstructed both &ast;_patay_ and &ast;_matay_ with the meaning ‘die, dead’ it is clear from the data assembled here that by at least [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) times a far richer complex of meanings was associated with &ast;_atay_, whether alone, affixed, or in combination with various other free morphemes. These meanings included not only ‘death’, ‘dead’, ‘die’, ‘kill’, and ‘corpse’ but also the following more figurative senses:",dempwolff193438[sect. 47e]

While it is clear that this is historically accurate it can be questioned whether the morpheme boundary was still present in these forms in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072), since the derivation of &ast;_aken_ from &ast;_aku_, &ast;_iten_ from &ast;_ita_ and &ast;_amen_ from &ast;_ami_ require two ordered operations: 1. deletion of the final vowel of the nominative pronoun, and 2. addition of a suffix &ast;_-en_ of unknown origin to the shortened stem (simple addition of &ast;_-en_ would have predictably produced &ast;&ast;__akun__, &ast;_itan_ and &ast;_amin_).  As noted in [Blust (1977)](Source#cldf:blust1977), and reinforced in [Ross (2006:533)](bib-Ross), all known Malayo-Polynesian reflexes show an irregular change of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_iten_ to [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_aten_, presumably as a result of paradigmatic leveling (&ast;_iten_ : &ast;_amen_ > &ast;_aten_ : &ast;_amen_).",blust1977
31574,*ami,a,"1pl. excl. nominative pronoun, we (exclusive)","Base forms of free pronouns are often difficult to decide.  Although the most common form for the first person plural exclusive pronoun is a reflex of &ast;_kami_, both Formosan and Malayo-Polynesian evidence suggests that the base was &ast;_ami_, with &ast;_k-ami_ containing a prefix of uncertain function.  [Blust (1977:8-9)](Source#cldf:blust1977) suggested that &ast;_kaSu_ ‘2sg’ next to &ast;_iSu_ ‘2sg.’ arose from &ast;_ka-iSu_ through a blend of the first syllable of &ast;_kamu_ ‘2pl.’ with the 2sg. base, and [Ross (2006:533)](bib-Ross) has suggested that this pattern was extended to other persons and numbers; the matter remains unsettled.  



A number of CEMP languages have lost &ast;_k-_ through regular sound change, and reflexes like _ami_ are assigned to &ast;_k-ami_ on the assumption that they reflect the more common form.  In assembling data for this comparison and other pronounsI have benefitted from [Ross (2006:533-534)](bib-Ross) for Formosan languages, [Tsuchida, Yamada and Moriguchi (1987:19-23)](Source#cldf:tsuchidayamadaandmoriguchi1987) for Bashiic, [Reid (1971)](Source#cldf:reid1971) for most Philippine minor languages, [Lobel (2016)](Source#cldf:lobel2016) for Sabahan, and [Pawley (1972)](Source#cldf:pawley1972) for eastern Oceanic.

24851,*-an,a,verbal suffix marking locative voice; nominal suffix marking location,"&ast;_-an_ is one of the more important affixes that can be reconstructed for [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) and [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081).  The reflexes in such languages as [Atayal](LanguageTable#cldf:493), [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423), [Murut (Timugon)](LanguageTable#cldf:1067) and [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573) show that [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_-an_ probably could co-occur with &ast;_-in-_ in past temporal expressions, and examples in other languages suggest that the final element in [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) &ast;_ka-_ (stem) _-an_ was identical to &ast;_-an_.  Reflexes of &ast;_-an_ are often the exclusive or principle morphological means of expressing the ‘locative focus’ in Philippine languages, and at the same time are commonly used to derive nouns of location.  It is, however, perhaps an oversimplification to associate &ast;_-an_ exclusively with semantic properties that can be characterized in a straightforward sense as ‘locative’.  To judge from its functioning reflexes in modern [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) and Philippine languages, and from its fossilized reflexes in other languages, &ast;_-an_ had multiple functions (alternatively, we might recognize more than one homophonous suffix).  



Thus, many of the languages of western Borneo have a form _tapan_ ‘winnowing basket’ (active verb: _napan_ ‘to winnow grain’) which reflects [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_tahep_ ‘up and down movement of grains being winnowed’ + &ast;_-an_, here receiving a more natural universal interpretation as instrumental rather than locative.  Particularly interesting is &ast;_tian-an_ ‘pregnant’ (from &ast;_tian_ ‘abdomen’ + &ast;_-an_), found in a number of WMP and OC languages, since here the suffix clearly was used adjectivally in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081).  Like &ast;_-en_, reflexes of &ast;_-an_ sometimes mean ‘inflicted with’ or ‘suffering from’ the referent of the base ([Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245), [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325), [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573)). In general the use of &ast;_-an_ decreases sharply as one moves southward from the Philippines, and eastward in Indonesia. The evidence for [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_-an_ is slim, but difficult to dismiss, although it probably was something of a relic affix in the eastern region of the Austronesian-speaking world even at this early time.",

None of the known Philippine reflexes refers specifically to a phosphorescent millipede, but two considerations favor the gloss I have given.  First, the semantic reflexes in [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) and the South Sulawesi languages agree closely in referring to such an insect.  Second, on the whole semantic extensions proceed by generalizing properites of the concrete objects of experience rather than by concretizing a priori general properties.  I thus consider it unlikely that &ast;_andap_ referred to phosphorescence as such.  It is probable that some still undeterminded morpheme which was marked by the &ast;_qali/kali-_ prefix also meant ‘luminous millipede’ ([Banjarese](LanguageTable#cldf:243) _halimañar_ ‘luminous millipede’, [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _kelemayar_ ‘luminous millipede’, [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314) _katikeran_ ‘phosphorescent millipede’, [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) _hatitioran_ ‘phosphorescent millipede’, [Ambai](LanguageTable#cldf:472) _halimontan_ ‘phosphorescent light of luminous millipede or toadstool’, [Malay (Jakarta)](LanguageTable#cldf:18430) _kalimayah_ ‘luminous millipede’, [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947) _andaʔ kalamoyan_ ‘phosphorescent millipede’).



David Mead (email of January 18, 2015) informs me that “in all of Southeast Asia there are only two described luminous _centipede_ species, of which only the first one listed below -- because of its wide distribution -- could have been the reference of &ast;_andap_.



1. _Orphnaeus brevilabiatus_ (Newport 1845), a small soil centipede, thread-like body about 3 cm long, 1 mm in diameter with 67 to 81 pairs of legs, known from Africa through Hawaii and the Galapagos Islands, a widely distributed ""tropical tramp species"" 


2. _Otostigmus aculeatus_ (Haase 1887) a small tropical centipede with a dark grey body (with prototypical centipede body shape); known distribution includes ""China; Indonesia (Java); Laos; Taiwan; Vietnam.



The confusion of _O. brevilabiatus_ with millipedes has two sources. First, the small size, elongated body shape and numerous leg pairs have caused non-specialists to confuse it with (true) millipedes -- and probably even more so when seen at night under dim lighting conditions. Second, the Dutch term _duizenpoot_, which can refer to both millipedes and centipedes, has probably added another layer of complexity when Dutch sources have been (mis)translated. There is no confusion on the part of myriapodologists, but, sadly, it must be laid at the feet of linguists and lexicographers. Thus, for example, Smith and Schmidgall-Tellings include in their _Comprehensive Indonesian-English Dictionary_ the self-contradictory entry: ""_kelemayar_ luminous millipede, glow-worm, _Orphnaeus brevilabiatus_."" And for a quarter-century in Sulawesi we employed a word list which asked for, as one of its items, the local word for ‘luminescent millipede’!”",

First, all languages except [Minangkabau](LanguageTable#cldf:337), [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372) and [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573) are ambiguous for the contrast of &ast;_q-_ and zero. [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372) and [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573) unambiguously reflect a form with initial vowel, whereas [Minangkabau](LanguageTable#cldf:337) unambiguously reflects a form with initial &ast;_q_.  The evidence for the onset is thus contradictory.  Similarly, [Aklanon](LanguageTable#cldf:226), [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) and [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276) unambiguously support &ast;_-ʔ_, whereas [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _agúho_, [Bikol](LanguageTable#cldf:244) _agúho_ contrarily support &ast;_-u_ ([Zorc 1982:115](Source#cldf:zorc1982)).  In an effort to accomodate some of these mutually incompatible correspondences I have reconstructed disjuncts &ast;_aRuhu_, &ast;_qaRuhu_, and assigned the [Aklanon](LanguageTable#cldf:226) and [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) forms with -/ʔ/ to this note rather than posit at least two more highly questionable disjuncts &ast;_aRuhuʔ_ and &ast;_qaRuhuʔ_.  


The magico-religious associations of the _Casuarina_ in Melanesia which are suggested by [Arosi](LanguageTable#cldf:485) _saru_ and [Mota](LanguageTable#cldf:344) _aru_ are further strengthened by e.g. [Tolai](LanguageTable#cldf:19416) _iāra_ ‘sp. of tree, _Casuarina equisetifolia_, the Australian pine or ‘she-oak’, the leaves of which are used as a magic charm and are believed to be especially potent in warding off evil spirits’.",zorc1982[127];zorc1982[115]

It is tempting to dismiss this cognate set as a product of borrowing from [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), but under such a hypothesis at least three observations remain unexplained: 1) the absence of the initial nasal in [Kadazan Dusun](LanguageTable#cldf:287), [Bisaya (Limbang)](LanguageTable#cldf:542), [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276) , and the Chamic languages, 2) the presence of the final glottal stop in [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276) and [Sasak](LanguageTable#cldf:404), and 3) the meanings of the reflexes in [Kadazan Dusun](LanguageTable#cldf:287) and [Bisaya (Limbang)](LanguageTable#cldf:542).  It is possible that this form began as an innovation in northern Borneo which spread to [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) while the latter still occupied the Malayic homeland of southwest Borneo.

[Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) _bagá_, however, almost certainly reflects &ast;_bajaq_ ‘say, relate, announce’, and the broader comparative evidence suggests that Kumintang [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _bagá_ is compounded of earlier monosyllables.",dempwolff193438;panganiban1973[93]

Since original medial nasals are otherwise retained in [Lonwolwol](LanguageTable#cldf:320) and since none of the other languages from which cognates are cited here could regularly reflect [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_pano_ (or [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_panaw_) Paton's interpretation of the [Lonwolwol](LanguageTable#cldf:320) form appears to be unjustified. 


This cognate set appears in [Blust (1993b:254)](Source#cldf:blust1993), where it is observed that [Nothofer (1992)](Source#cldf:nothofer1992), favors a comparison with [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245) _bayaʔ_ ‘go’ < [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_bayaq_.  Nothofer's proposal has the advantage of eliminating a canonical anomaly (since [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) monosyllabic content morphemes are otherwise virtually unknown), but conflicts with the [Motu](LanguageTable#cldf:345) reflex (&ast;_bayaq_ should > &ast;&ast;_hala_).  Alternatively [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245) _bayaʔ_ and all of the items cited here except [Motu](LanguageTable#cldf:345) _ha_ could be assigned to &ast;_bayaq_.



This is one of the extremely rare monosyllables that appears to have been a content morpheme in [PCEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19074). Although the glosses for CMP languages suggest that it was a main verb, several of the Oceanic reflexes indicate that it was an auxiliary, and as such it may have been unstressed and so a part of the following phonological word (hence the comment by [Codrington and Palmer (1896)](bib-Codrington) that [Mota](LanguageTable#cldf:344) _va_ ‘go or come’ is sometimes hard to distinguish from the causative prefix _va-_).",paton1973;blust1993;nothofer1992

If there is one prototype meaning that can be identified for &ast;_baba_ it is ‘to carry a child pick-a-back’.  The term presumably also extended to the transport of sick or injured adults in a similar manner, but its full semantic range remains unclear.  The nominal referents in [Casiguran Dumagat](LanguageTable#cldf:569), [Kelabit](LanguageTable#cldf:299) and [Wolio](LanguageTable#cldf:1124) fail to agree, and probably are secondary.  [Bimanese](LanguageTable#cldf:241) _waʔa_ ‘carry’, [Manggarai](LanguageTable#cldf:816) _ba_, _wa_ ‘carry, accompany, take along’ exhibit an apparent semantic generalization similar to that seen in [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314), [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660) and some of the languages of Sulawesi, but show phonological irregularities which cast doubt on the appropriateness of including these forms in the present cognate set.",

At the same time universal tendencies were no less operative in proto-languages than they are in attested languages, and &ast;_baba_ is just as likely to be an inherited form which resisted regular sound change in languages such as [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432), [Atoni](LanguageTable#cldf:231), [Fordata](LanguageTable#cldf:18184) and [Kei](LanguageTable#cldf:298) as a result of the recurrent reinforcement that nursery language provided.

In isolation both &ast;_babaq_₁ and &ast;_babaw_₃ probably were nouns meaning ‘lower surface/bottom’ and ‘upper surface/top’.

30164,*bahi,b,female,"As noted in [Blust (1982b)](Source#cldf:blust1982) from a morphological standpoint this is one of the most challenging of all Austronesian comparisons.  In addition to the reduplicated and infixed forms of &ast;_bahi_ that are reconstructed here there are numerous other affixed forms that are confined to particular languages or genetically restricted groups of languages, and a few that are widespread but semantically heterogeneous.  


The following is a selection of affixed bases that may or may not indicate proto-forms with similar morphology: 1) [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) _ka-babai_ ‘the smaller part of a pair’, [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) _ka-babai_ ‘feminine — esp. applied to female nut called _togaiaq_’, 2) [Bontok](LanguageTable#cldf:246) _ka-babaiy-an_ ‘sister or female cousin of a male Ego’, [Kankanaey](LanguageTable#cldf:289) _ka-babai-an_ ‘girl, maiden, lass’, [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _ka-babai-han_ ‘womanhood; women as a group’, [Bikol](LanguageTable#cldf:244) _ka-babayi-an_ ‘women’, [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) _ka-babayi-nan_ ‘women as a group’, 3) [Puyuma](LanguageTable#cldf:386) _maki-baya-bayan_ ‘copulate’, [Isneg](LanguageTable#cldf:647) _maki-babbáy_ ‘be concupiscent, lustful’, 4) [Hanunóo](LanguageTable#cldf:273) _bayi-ʔán_ ‘doe, the female of deer’, [Binukid](LanguageTable#cldf:19012) _bahi-an_, and [Manobo (Western Bukidnon)](LanguageTable#cldf:819) _behi-ʔan_ ‘female animal’.  


The last of these may point to [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:19083) _&ast;bahi-ʔan_ ‘female, of animals’, but this inference would be much more secure if a similar meaning were found in other, more distantly related languages.  While similar forms do occur in Taiwan, elsewhere in the Philippines and in Malagasy, their meanings are widely divergent ([Rukai (Tona)](LanguageTable#cldf:970) _abayánə_, [Puyuma](LanguageTable#cldf:386) _ba-bay-an_, [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) _va-vay-an_ ‘woman’, [Ifugaw](LanguageTable#cldf:636) _ba-bay-án_ ‘sexual organs of a woman’, [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) _bayi-nan_ ‘people on the bride’s side in a marriage’, [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432) _va-vai-ána_ ‘be made to have a companion’), and so no higher-order reconstruction appears possible at present.  


Finally, like several other nouns referring to people the word for ‘woman’ appears to have had a plural form distinguished by length of the penultimate vowel, as in [Kapampangan](LanguageTable#cldf:291) , [Motu](LanguageTable#cldf:345) and most Polynesian languages.  Cross-cutting the evidence for plural marking by lengthening of the penult is the evidence from several languages in western Melanesia for a singular : plural distinction based on the contrast of /_a_/ and /_i_/ [Molima](LanguageTable#cldf:18975) _wavine_ ‘woman’ : _wivine_ ‘women’, etc.).  If this distinction is posited for [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) it may help to explain the otherwise irregular first-syllable /_i_/ in a number of other languages that are not known to distinguish plural from singular in this way, as [Nali](LanguageTable#cldf:878) _pihin_, [Sori](LanguageTable#cldf:1021) _bibiŋ_, [Wuvulu](LanguageTable#cldf:445) _pifine_, [Tanga](LanguageTable#cldf:425) _fifin_ or [Niue](LanguageTable#cldf:362) _fifine_ ‘woman’.",blust1982

Surprisingly, [Manam](LanguageTable#cldf:328) on the north coast of New Guinea, and a number of the languages of Vanuatu agree in pointing to a verb ‘to smell’ which combines apparent reflexes of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_bahu_ and &ast;_deŋeR_ ‘to hear’, an association that appears also in [Tawala](LanguageTable#cldf:1056) _nonola_ ‘hearsmell’ ([Ezard 1985](Source#cldf:ezard1985)).

In view of this characterization it is somewhat surprising that a cognate is found in [Thao](LanguageTable#cldf:1062), which is spoken around Sun-Moon Lake, at an elevation of nearly 1000 meters in the western foothills of the Central Mountains of Taiwan.  There is evidence that [Thao](LanguageTable#cldf:1062) was spoken on Taiwan's Western Plain ([Blust 1996](Source#cldf:blust1996)), perhaps as recently as the 17th century, but even then it probably would not have been in contact with the sea. However, the _Crinum asiaticum_ is reported from inland riverine environments in Indonesia as well (cf. reflexes in [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) and [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276)).  In any event [Thao](LanguageTable#cldf:1062) _fakun_ was spontaneously offered as the name of the _Crinum asiaticum_ when a color photograph of the latter was presented to Mr. Shih A-shan, and there can be little doubt about the botanical identification.",merrill1954[35];blust1996

25074,*baliw₁,b,"dual division, moiety == cluster (a) answer, oppose, opposite side or part; partner, friend, enemy","This is among the most complex comparisons known in Austronesian.  For convenience in perceiving semantic groupings the reflexes have been segregated into three clusters, but all are believed to continue the same etymon.  The lexicographical issue at stake is how the linguist can distinguish homophony from polysemy in a principled way in cases such as this.  On the one hand we could posit homophones (1) &ast;_baliw_ ‘answer, oppose; opposite side or part; partner, friend, enemy’; (2) &ast;_baliw_ ‘repay, return in kind; retaliate, take revenge (hence: to equalize a loss or debt)’; and (3) &ast;_baliw_ ‘don mourning apparel; mourn for a deceased spouse’.  


However, there are multiple problems with this analysis.  First, &ast;_-iw_ occurs in only three of the over 2,200 reconstructions in [Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) (&ast;_baliw_ ‘change’, &ast;_baRiw_ ‘spoiled, tainted’, &ast;_laRiw_ ‘flee’), and it would therefore be unexpected to find this rare diphthong in three additional morphemes all of which are homophonous with &ast;_baliw_ ‘change’.  Second, suffixed forms reflecting &ast;_baliw-an_ occur in at least the semantic clusters (b) and (c).  Third, and most critically, all three semantic clusters are related by a pervasive notion of duality, and are fully consistent with descriptions of the psychology of dual divisions in the ethnological literature (see [Blust 1980a](Source#cldf:blust1980), [Blust 1981b](Source#cldf:blust1981) for further discussion).  


On the other hand, we could unite at least the material cited here, as indeed we have done.  Dempwolff did not consider this material, but as noted already he split &ast;_baliw_₂ into two separate etyma.  Later writers, as [Mills (1975)](Source#cldf:mills1975) have made similar decisions (in favor of homophony rather than polysemy) for some of the material cited under &ast;_baliw_₁ (a).  There can now be little question that all of the forms gathered under &ast;_baliw_₁ reflect a single etymon.  It is, moreover, likely that &ast;_baliw_₁ and &ast;_baliw_₂ were the same morpheme. However, the rather distinct character of the glosses associated with reflexes of &ast;_baliw_₂, particularly those relating to punitive storms ([Blust 1981](Source#cldf:blust1981)), is difficult to reconcile with a hypothesis of a unitary [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) etymon &ast;_baliw_. Formally most [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) cognates appear to reflect the nasal grade of &ast;_b_, but a few languages ([Lakalai](LanguageTable#cldf:877), [Mota](LanguageTable#cldf:344), [Lonwolwol](LanguageTable#cldf:320)) evidently reflect the oral grade. I am indebted to Ann Chowning and Ross Clark (p.c.) for useful comments and data relating to this comparison.  As Clark points out, [Mota](LanguageTable#cldf:344) _val_ may not belong with the other forms cited here.",dempwolff193438;blust1980;blust1981;mills1975;blust1981

The fuller comparison given here suggests that the supporting evidence cited by Dempwolff belongs to a single cognate set in which the rare diphthong &ast;_-iw_ was occasionally altered by metathesis.  Next to its more general meaning it is clear that by [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) times &ast;_baliw_ referred to a supernatural punitive storm precipitated by incest or mockery of animals (see [Blust 1981](Source#cldf:blust1981) for a fuller discussion).  Although a belief in such punitive storms is also found among speakers of [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076) and [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) languages, as the [Ngadha](LanguageTable#cldf:357) of Flores and the [Suau](LanguageTable#cldf:1022) of southeast New Guinea, it is unclear whether a reflex of &ast;_baliw_ is used to designate them, and hence whether the meaning of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_baliw_ included this referent.",dempwolff193438;blust1981

25076,*balizi,b,kind of grass,"Reconstructed as &ast;_bali[jzZ]i_ ‘grass’ in [Blust (1970)](Source#cldf:blust1970).  With regard to the last consonant [Simalur](LanguageTable#cldf:415) _balixi_, _falixi_ unambiguously indicates &ast;_j_, but [Pak](LanguageTable#cldf:371) _penit_, [Nauna](LanguageTable#cldf:355) _pelic_ point to [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_ns_, [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_z_, all other known reflexes being indeterminate.  Although this item can be securely reconstructed, the supporting cognate set is problematic in this and in certain other respects.  
First, northern Philippine forms such [Kankanaey](LanguageTable#cldf:289) _balíli_ ‘a rush: _Juncus effusus L._’ and [Ifugaw](LanguageTable#cldf:636) _balíli_ ‘kind of tough grass with long leaves’ are either similar to the above forms by chance, or exhibit an unparalleled development of &ast;_j_, and &ast;_z_.  It is thus possible that all Philippine forms reflect an etymon &ast;_balili_ which is distinct from &ast;_baliji_ or &ast;_balizi_.  


Second, the two intervocalic consonants in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_palisi_ appear to have metathesized independently in at least three [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) languages: [Proto-Willaumez](LanguageTable#cldf:19093), [Selau](LanguageTable#cldf:410) (and perhaps other languages of Buka and Bougainville), and [Proto-Micronesian](LanguageTable#cldf:19079).  In at least the latter case the metathesis in this item evidently is part of a more general change (cp. [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_paluja_ > [Proto-Micronesian](LanguageTable#cldf:19079) &ast;_fasula_ ‘to paddle’).  


Nonetheless the possibility remains that [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) had doublets &ast;_palisi_ and &ast;_pasili_ which show a complementary pattern of retention.  Finally, it is unclear whether [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_baliji_, &ast;_balizi_ referred to a particular type of grass, or whether it functioned as a generic term.  If the latter was the case this reconstruction runs counter to the claim of [Brown (1984)](Source#cldf:brown1984) that the generic category ‘tree’ is always lexically encoded before the generic category ‘grass’.",blust1970;brown1984

According to [Merrill (1954)](Source#cldf:merrill1954) the _Thespesia populnea_ is a close relative of the _Hibiscus tiliaceus_ (&ast;_baRu_), and like the latter its bark yields a useful fiber.  Both of these plants and the _Gnetum gnemon_ (&ast;_baguh_) share similar useful properties and a similar phonemic shape.  Where a specific identification is not given in the source the reflexes of &ast;_balu_ and &ast;_baRu_ or of &ast;_baguh_ and &ast;_baRu_ (but never of all three) may be confused in languages that merge &ast;_l_ and &ast;_R_ or &ast;_g_ and &ast;_R_ respectively.",merrill1954

Reflexes of &ast;_balutu_ are widely distributed throughout the Philippines, while reflexes of a variant &ast;_barutu_ also occur in Southern Luzon, the Bisayas, and Mindanao. A [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:19083) etymon &ast;_balutu_ thus seems fairly secure. In addition, [Stresemann (1927)](Source#cldf:stresemann1927) posited ""Sub-Ambon"" &ast;_balutu_ ‘sailboat’ based solely on [Saparua](LanguageTable#cldf:990) _palutu_. Together with the Philippine forms this reconstruction suggests a [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) term &ast;_balutu_ which referred to some type of boat. However, Stresemann's source for [Saparua](LanguageTable#cldf:990) ([van Hoëvell 1877](bib-van)) does not list _palutu_. Collins (p.c.) notes that similar, but apparently non-corresponding forms are found in some languages on the north coast of Seram (Salas _palút_, Benggoi _balútam_, Kobi _balóta_). However, the lack of clear cognates outside the Philippines, and the feebleness of attestation in the Moluccas raises suspicions that this form was not found in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081). 


[Samal](LanguageTable#cldf:981) _balutu_ ‘kind of outrigger canoe’ is assumed to be a Philippine loan, and it is possible that the Moluccan forms were borrowed from Sama-Bajaw sea nomads. As support for this view, Collins (p.c.) reports that other names for types of boats were introduced into the Moluccas during the recent past by immigrants from Sulawesi. Moreover, there are other linguistic indications of the incursion of [Samal](LanguageTable#cldf:981) speakers into Indonesia, as with [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325) _balaŋiŋiʔ_ ‘sea nomad’ (a reference to the Balangingi Samal).

 It is unclear why a number of languages extending from the Philippines to Melanesia have an irregular /_o_/ in the last syllable of this word.  A possible explanation is that the [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) or [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) form contained a rare last syllable &ast;_o_, but for the present I choose not to increase the number of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) or [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) vowels through the reconstruction of questionable distinctions such as this.  The essential meaning of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_baŋuN_ and its reflexes through at least [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) was ‘wake up, get up from sleeping’.  It is clear from a number of affixed reflexes that this word did not refer simply to the psychological act of awakening from sleep, but more particularly to the physical act of arising after awakening.  It is evidently the latter semantic component which has been elaborated in many of the languages of the Philippines and Indonesia into transitive verbs which refer to the physical action of erecting or setting something upright, or to the symbolic act of establishing something from nothing.",

[Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) reconstructed &ast;_bagi_, but marked it as a Sanskrit loan.  A similar interpretation of [Sasak](LanguageTable#cldf:404) _bagi_ is found in [Goris (1938)](Source#cldf:goris1938).  However, [Wilkinson (1959)](Source#cldf:wilkinson1959) does not mark [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _bagi_, _bahagi_ as a loan, and the form is conspicuously absent in [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660).  Moreover, the agreement of [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947) _-ʔC-_ with [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _-haC-_ parallels a correspondence in an indisputably native form: [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947) _baʔru_, [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _baharu_ ‘new’.  The quality of the deleted vowel in this word evidently differed from that in &ast;_baqeRu_ (&ast;_baqeRu_ > _baharu_ ~ _bahru_ ~ _baru_, but &ast;_baqegi_ > _bahagi_, _bagi_ without a variant &ast;&ast;_bahgi_).  



Dempwolff's interpretation appears to be based on the assumption that this form derives from Sanskrit _bhāgya_ ‘good fortune, luck’ (see ‘Loans and convergent developments’). Indeed a confusion of these two words ([Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _bahagi_, _bagi_ ‘mete out, apportion’, and _bahagia_ ‘good fortune sent by God’) is apparent in some languages: e.g. [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) _bagiʔ-an_ ‘share, portion, belong to, fate’, where the native [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) word and the Sanskrit loan are both borrowed (from [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326)) and treated as a single polysemous form, presumably on the notion that one's inheritance equals one's fortune or fate.  


Although this word appears to be native in [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947), and some other languages, part of the attested distribution, including the forms in [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331), [Sangir](LanguageTable#cldf:402), and perhaps all [CEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19074) languages, probably is due to borrowing from [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326).",dempwolff193438;goris1938;wilkinson1959

In addition there are three other meanings (‘speak, say’, ‘door’, and ‘bad breath’) which appear in geographically separated reflexes. Since better candidates are available for the first two meanings these senses are perhaps best regarded as historically secondary developments, or as figurative usages in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) or [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094).  Although no other candidate is available for the third meaning, it too is perhaps best treated as convergent.

29829,*baqi,b,grandmother,"Also  [Kalamian Tagbanwa](LanguageTable#cldf:18285) _bai-ʔ_  (expected &ast;&ast;baki).  This is not a robust cognate set, yet one that undeniably points to a [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) term for ‘grandmother’, as unambiguous reflexes of &ast;_baqi_ are found from central Taiwan to the western edge of the Lesser Sundas.   [Kavalan](LanguageTable#cldf:293)  has  _baqi_  ‘grandfather (add.); grandson’,  _baq-baqi_  ‘ancestors’ next to  _bai_  ‘grandmother’.   Both are regular, the first word from &ast;_baki_ and the second from &ast;_baqi_, a development that can cause confusion, since the word for ‘grandfather’ has acquired a phonemic shape that is identical to that of the [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) original for ‘grandmother’.  The final glottal stop in [Palawan Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:247) _baʔíʔ_  is paralleled by a similar pattern in other kin terms (&ast;_ama_ >  _amáʔ_  ‘father’, &ast;_apu_ >  _apóʔ_  ‘grandfather’, &ast;_Suaji_ >  _arí?_  ‘younger brother’, &ast;_ina_ >  _ináʔ_  ‘mother’), and is assumed to be a marker of the vocative ([Blust 1979](Source#cldf:blust1979)).

It has a yellow streak extending from the eye and gives it a rather languid look, whence _mata biuku_ (tortoise eyes) = ‘sheep’s eyes’’.  


This is an extremely frustrating set of data.  A Proto-Philippine reconstruction can be justified only by assuming that [Agutaynen](LanguageTable#cldf:19189) _bakoko_ reflects &ast;_baququ_. However, the range of irregular variation with this word is exceptional, and it may well be that [Agutaynen](LanguageTable#cldf:19189) _bakoko_ continues a variant form with &ast;_k_. Of those non-conforming but evidently related forms cited in this note, only [Ilongot](LanguageTable#cldf:642) _bakukul_, and [Pangasinan](LanguageTable#cldf:920) _bakokól_ can be reconciled phonologically, so that the remaining words appear to point to at least five variants in addition to &ast;_baququ_ (&ast;_baqulqul_, &ast;_bakukul_, &ast;_bayuqu_, &ast;_buqu_, &ast;_bayuku_).  [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _biuku_, the only apparent cognate known outside the Philippines, is nearly comparable with [Palawan Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:247) _bayóʔo_, but reflects &ast;_k_ rather than &ast;_q_ as the onset of the final syllable",

[Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) compared the [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423), [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) and [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) forms cited here, along with [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285) _meliwis_ (a form which I find neither in [Pigeaud 1938](Source#cldf:pigeaud1938) nor in [Zoetmulder 1982](Source#cldf:zoetmulder1982)), and reconstructed &ast;_baliwis_ ‘wild duck’.  However, under his reconstruction no two forms are regular (irregularities include [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) _-r-_, [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _-b-_, and [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285) _m-_).  


The present reconstruction has the merit of reconciling the [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) and [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) forms, but leaves the reflex of &ast;_r_ irregular both in [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) and in [Balinese](LanguageTable#cldf:235).  A fairly thorough search for other reflexes which might resolve some of these problems has produced no results.  If this form is not a local innovation which has been spread by borrowing, it is puzzling why no other reflexes have been uncovered. 


On the other hand, if it is a local innovation the most likely route of diffusion would be from [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) into [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423), yet the disagreement of [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _-b-_, [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _-w-_ argues against this interpretation. Standard ornithological sources such as [Peters (1931-1951)](Source#cldf:peters193151) indicate that three species of whistling ducks are widespread in the Austronesian world: _Dendrocygna arcuata_, _D. javanica_, and _D. guttata_.  There is thus no a priori reason to suspect that this form is a loan from a non-Austronesian source.",dempwolff193438;pigeaud1938;zoetmulder1982;peters193151

25155,*baRa₁,b,"hand, arm","All [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) reflexes of &ast;_baRa_ contain an obligatory possessive suffix; in addition [Letemboi](LanguageTable#cldf:733) _na-vara-ŋ_ contains a reflex of the common noun article &ast;_na_.  It is possible that all forms collected here should be assigned to &ast;_qabaRa_ ‘shoulder’ (q.v.), with parallel semantic shifts that have created the illusion of an independent comparison.  I regard this hypothesis as unlikely, but am hard-pressed to suggest how &ast;_baRa_ might have differed in meaning or function from the far better-attested &ast;_(qa)lima_ ‘hand, arm’. Finally, Taroko _baga_ ‘hand, arm’ might be included in this comparison. [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_R_ normally yields Taroko _l_ (&ast;_baRaq_ > _balaq_ ‘lung’, &ast;_uRaC_ > _ulat_ ‘vein, tendon’), but appears to yield _g_ in &ast;_Rabiʔi_ > _gabi-yan_ ‘evening’. Moreover, it is clear from the data in [Li (1981)](Source#cldf:li1981) that while [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_R_ generally became _g_ in [Atayal](LanguageTable#cldf:493) and _r_ in [Seediq](LanguageTable#cldf:407) dialects, occasionally both languages reflect &ast;_R_ as _g_. Since Taroko _baga_ does not presently appear to be corroborated by cognate forms in other dialects of [Seediq](LanguageTable#cldf:407) or [Atayal](LanguageTable#cldf:493), however, it is perhaps best to consider it provisionally as showing a chance resemblance to the forms cited under &ast;_baRa_.",li1981

The data brought together here present a more complex picture in that reflexes of Dempwolff's &ast;_(rR)_ point unambiguously to &ast;_l_ ([Uma](LanguageTable#cldf:19170), [Bare'e](LanguageTable#cldf:236), [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947) and [Mandar](LanguageTable#cldf:813)), &ast;_r_ ([Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577), [Nggela](LanguageTable#cldf:359), [Lau](LanguageTable#cldf:313), [Sa'a](LanguageTable#cldf:18945)) or &ast;_R_ ([Rotuman](LanguageTable#cldf:394), [Fijian](LanguageTable#cldf:266), Polynesian) in different collections of languages.

The reconstruction of &ast;_baRaq_ ‘red’ in [Blust (1989)](Source#cldf:blust1989) confuses a probable reflex of &ast;_baRah_ ([Gaddang](LanguageTable#cldf:268) _nali-baga_ ‘red’) and a reflex of &ast;_baReq_ ‘abscess, swelling’ ([Balinese](LanguageTable#cldf:235) _bahah_ ‘swollen and red’). Although it appeared to be justified by the occurrence of a root &ast;[-Raq](cf.csv#cldf:Root-30076) (seen also in &ast;_daRaq_ ‘blood’ and &ast;_ma-iRaq_ ‘red’), this reconstruction has now been abandoned.",blust1989
25144,*baRani,b,"hero, war-leader; dare to do","Also [Ngadha](LanguageTable#cldf:357) _bani_ ‘bold, daring, fearless; impudent; heroic; violent’. [Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) reconstructed &ast;_ba-Rani_ ‘fearless’, cross-referenced to &ast;_Rani_ ‘courage, manliness’.  However, the latter form is based solely on [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) _hañi_ (apparently a back-formation from &ast;&ast;_bahani_, which was assumed to contain the common verb prefix _ba-_) and the arbitrarily segmented final portion of [Fijian](LanguageTable#cldf:266) _taŋ-ane_, [Futunan](LanguageTable#cldf:607) _t-ane_ ‘man, male’.  The optional [Maloh](LanguageTable#cldf:327) form _rani_ and the similar obligatory forms in [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) and several languages of the Lesser Sundas ([Manggarai](LanguageTable#cldf:816), [Rembong](LanguageTable#cldf:391), [Ngadha](LanguageTable#cldf:357)) are assumed to be sporadic reductions of &ast;_baRanih_. 


 In [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094)  this term apparently referred in particular to a culturally prescribed hero whose status was defined by exploits in war, probably involving the taking of human life.  In [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) only the more general meaning ‘brave, fearless; to dare’ can be justified.  Finally, it is unclear from the isolated [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) reflex which preserves a final vowel whether the sporadic change &ast;_-i_ > /_e_/ had already occurred in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082), or whether it took place at some time between the break-up of [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) and the emergence of [Roviana](LanguageTable#cldf:396) as a distinct language.",dempwolff193438
31164,*baRaŋ,b,rib (?),"Also [Thao](LanguageTable#cldf:1062) _falhán_ ‘rib’, with irregular final stress.  The meaning of &ast;_baRaŋ_ is unclear.  While it evidently referred to a part of the body that included the region of the thoracic cavity, it is in competition with the better-supported [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_tageRaŋ_ in the meaning ‘ribcage’. This comparison was first brought to my attention by Laurent Sagart.",
25147,*baRaq₁,b,lung,"Also [Thao](LanguageTable#cldf:1062) _faq_, [Bunun](LanguageTable#cldf:250) _bahaq_, [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) _va_ ‘lungs’.  The rich attestation of this form in _Taiwan_ and the _Philippines_ contrasts markedly with its rarity elsewhere. Known reflexes are entirely lacking in Borneo and Sulawesi, occur in only three [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) languages outside the Philippines, in only two [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076) languages and in a single subgroup of [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) languages (cf. [Bender et al.  2003](Source#cldf:benderetal2003), [Proto-Micronesian](LanguageTable#cldf:19079) &ast;_fara_ ‘lungs’).  



The gemination in [Kankanaey](LanguageTable#cldf:289) _ballá_ presumably is to be explained by the shortness of the preceding unstressed vowel (although such a conditioned change is not regular), while the [Kapampangan](LanguageTable#cldf:291), [Hanunóo](LanguageTable#cldf:273), [Tiruray](LanguageTable#cldf:433), and [Tboli](LanguageTable#cldf:19175) reflexes are Central Philippine  loans.  Among other irregularities, [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) _va_, [Palawan Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:247) _bagá_ ‘lungs’ suggest the need for a doublet &ast;_baRa_.  However, contrary to [Warren (1959)](Source#cldf:warren1959), [Reid (1971)](Source#cldf:reid1971) gives [Palawan Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:247) _bagaʔ_ ‘lungs’.  On the other hand, [Reid (1971)](Source#cldf:reid1971) lists [Manobo (Ilianen)](LanguageTable#cldf:822) _baha_ ‘lungs’ without an expected final consonant, and [Ho (1978)](Source#cldf:ho1978) shows that the lack of expected _-q_ is common to all five [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) dialects that he examines.  For the present these are assumed to be independent irregularities, although it is possible that doublets &ast;_baRaq_, &ast;_baRa_ already existed in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072). 

Finally, the independent testimony of [Simalur](LanguageTable#cldf:415) and [Rotinese](LanguageTable#cldf:395) suggests that a conceptual link between the lungs (associated with the breath = life force, soul) and the liver (= seat of the emotions and life) may have been present already in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) (cp. also [Dondo](LanguageTable#cldf:584), [Totoli](LanguageTable#cldf:1084) _ate bula_ ‘lungs’, [Kelabit](LanguageTable#cldf:299) _ate ruaʔ_ ‘lungs’, with _ate_ < &ast;_qaCay_ ‘liver’) .  Whether such a link was encoded by a culturally prescribed dyadic set in ritual language ([Fox 1974](Source#cldf:fox1974)) or in some other way remains to be determined.",benderetal2003;warren1959;reid1971;reid1971;ho1978;fox1974

All known [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) reflexes point to &ast;_baRija_, while [MP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) witnesses contrarily indicate &ast;_balija_.

The _Hibiscus tiliaceus_ is a widely distributed and economically useful shrub or small tree.  The similarly useful _Thespesia populnea_ is sometimes represented by a reflex of &ast;_baRu_, but appears to have originally been represented by a distinct but very similar morpheme &ast;_balu_ (q.v.). 



In addition a number of dictionaries cite tree names that reflect &ast;_baRu_, but which in some cases may have no connection with the present cognate set.  Examples include [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) _vau_ ‘Blumea balsamifera (leaves called _lamud_ used for covering tubers while cooking)’, [Isneg](LanguageTable#cldf:647) _báxo_ ‘tree suitable for the preparation of primitive beehives’, [Ifugaw](LanguageTable#cldf:636) _bagú_ ‘kind of tree, the bark of which may serve as a provisional cloth or as a mat to sleep on’, [Manobo (Western Bukidnon)](LanguageTable#cldf:819) _bagu_ ‘small tree, prob. _Fagraea racemosa_’, [Simalur](LanguageTable#cldf:415) _balu_, _falu_, _tulaŋ balu_ ‘tree sp.’, [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314) _baru_ ‘plant resembling the _kurri_ (ramie, or hemp plant) the flowers of which stick like burrs to the clothes’, [Sundanese](LanguageTable#cldf:418) _waru_ ‘tree belonging to the willow family which yields a good timber’, [Ngadha](LanguageTable#cldf:357) _varu_ ‘tree and gourd sp.’, [Buruese](LanguageTable#cldf:251) _bahu_ ‘a tree: _Shorea_ sp.’, [Buli](LanguageTable#cldf:249) _pai_ ‘tree sp.’, [Manam](LanguageTable#cldf:328) _paru_ ‘a tree: _Mangas Pid._ (leaf used for cigarettes)’, [Nggela](LanguageTable#cldf:359) _valu_ ‘tree sp.’, ['Āre'āre](LanguageTable#cldf:18004) _haru_ ‘a shrub’, [Arosi](LanguageTable#cldf:485) _haru_ ‘tree sp.’, and [Fijian](LanguageTable#cldf:266) _bau_ ‘tree with edible fruit and beautiful brownish-red wood, used to make canoes, boxes, etc.: _Sapotaceae_ sp.’.  



The value of this plant as a source of cordage is reflected linguistically in two very distinct ways in [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) languages: (1) In [Proto-Micronesian](LanguageTable#cldf:19079) the word for ‘hibiscus’ reflects [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_kulit_ ‘skin, bark’ + &ast;_baRu_, the name for the valuable bark having come to stand for the entire tree; (2) [Proto-Micronesian](LanguageTable#cldf:19079) &ast;_fau fau_ ‘tie, bind, lash’; [Fijian](LanguageTable#cldf:266) _vau_ ‘tie, bind’, [Niue](LanguageTable#cldf:362) _fau_ ‘construct by tying, bind together, lash’, [Samoan](LanguageTable#cldf:401) _fau_ ‘bind, lash together’, [Kapingamarangi](LanguageTable#cldf:292) _hau_ ‘lash, tie, construct’, and similar verbs in other languages also appear to derive from &ast;_baRu_.

25179,*baRuaŋ,b,the Malayan sun bear: Ursus malayanus,"Also [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) _baroaŋ_ ‘primitive, ape, bear (animal)’.  This cognate set is geographically more restricted than most cognate sets that are attributed to [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094).  Reflexes of &ast;_baRuaŋ_, &ast;_biRuaŋ_, however, are widespread in Borneo and are clearly native, as they have sometimes undergone extensive sound changes which have not affected loans.  This is particularly noticeable in languages that have strengthened non-phonemic transitional glides, as with [Long Glat (Modang)](LanguageTable#cldf:850) _wahaguŋ_ (where /_g_/ reflects the intervocalic glide that was phonetically present between the vowels &ast;_-ua-_, which then metathesized), [Kiput](LanguageTable#cldf:18958) (where /_f_/ reflects the similar glide), [Bintulu](LanguageTable#cldf:242) (where &ast;_R_ disappeared, and from intermediate &ast;_buaŋ_ the same transitional glide was strengthened to /_b_/ and the preceding &ast;_u_ centralized) and [Berawan (Long Terawan)](LanguageTable#cldf:19191) (where intervocalic &ast;_R_ became /_k_/, the first syllable was lost, and the strengthening of the phonetic glide and centralization of &ast;_u_ paralleled the development in [Kiput](LanguageTable#cldf:18958)).  Indeed, the cognation of [Bintulu](LanguageTable#cldf:242) _bebaŋ_ and particularly of [Berawan (Long Terawan)](LanguageTable#cldf:19191) _kebiŋ_ with e.g. [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _beruaŋ_ is far from obvious, but is borne out by careful study of the sound correspondences.

Of the four languages that he compared ([Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577), [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427), and [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285)), the first two have merged all vocalic oppositions in prepenultimate position, [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) _baruaŋ_ differs in meaning and may not be cognate, and [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285) _beruaŋ_, like [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) _baroaŋ_ and [Buginese](LanguageTable#cldf:239) _baruaŋ_, appears to be a Malay loanword.  His unambiguous reconstruction of first-syllable &ast;_a_ was thus apparently an illusion.  Both [Banjarese](LanguageTable#cldf:243) and [Minangkabau](LanguageTable#cldf:337) preserve the contrast of &ast;_a_ and &ast;_i_ in prepenultimate position ([Adelaar 1992](Source#cldf:adelaar1992)), and these witnesses agree in indicating &ast;_i_.  The reflexes in [Murut (Paluan)](LanguageTable#cldf:917), [Kadazan Dusun](LanguageTable#cldf:287), and [Lun Dayeh](LanguageTable#cldf:19418), on the other hand, indicate &ast;_a_.  


Finally, the first appearance of this word must date from at least the entry of the ancestral population of present-day Austronesian speakers into Borneo (hence to approximately the period 2,000-1,500 B.C.).  It may, however, be considerably older.  The bear, generally designated by a reflex of &ast;_Cumay_, is also found in Taiwan, but is absent in the intervening Philippines.  In Southeast Asia it is found only on Borneo, the Malay Peninsula, and Sumatra.  Since &ast;_Cumay_ and &ast;_baRuaŋ_, &ast;_biRuaŋ_ are not cognate, no certain inference can be made about a [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) word for ‘bear’.  The distribution of word and referent in this case provides an instructive contrast with reflexes of &ast;_qaRem_ ‘pangolin’ (q.v.), where the animal has the same discontinuous distribution (Taiwan and Borneo), but the native names are cognate, thus requiring a [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) reconstruction.",dempwolff193438;adelaar1992

The latter is defined as ‘wijwater’ (holy water), and is cross-referenced with _laoe peŋoeras_.  Under _oeras_ Neumann gives _ŋoeras_ ‘purify (of weapons, etc.) with lemon juice’, _ŋoerasi_ ‘purify, by means of _laoe peŋoeras_, of evil influences which may attach to persons or things’.  The reference to the juice of citrus fruits as a medium of ritual purification in this gloss and less directly in the gloss for [Bikol](LanguageTable#cldf:244) _basbás_ is strengthened by parallel practices among the Bagobo of Mindanao and among the Austroasiatic-speaking inhabitants of the Nicobar islands ([Blust 1981: fn. 23](Source#cldf:blust1981)).  


Based on the evidence available to date it appears that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_basbas_ referred to a ritual ablution which involved the sprinkling of water or citrus juice (or a mixture of the two) on the object for purification.  In language groups that have become more acculturated to world religions (as the Christian [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) and Moslem [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325)) the original sense of this term has been reinterpreted in different ways.  There is no known evidence that the notion of ritual ablution was found in the [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) (as opposed to the [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081)) term.

Philippine  forms point uniformly to &ast;_batak_, while Western Indonesian forms that are not ambiguous for the &ast;_a_/_e_ distinction point to &ast;_batek_. The reconstruction proposed here assumes that  [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276),  [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) _batak_ reflect a form with last-syllable &ast;_a_ rather than &ast;_e_.",
29849,*bataŋ,b,"tree trunk, fallen tree, log; stem of a plant; body; corpse; self; bridge of the nose; most important or preeminent thing; main course of a river; mushroom or bracket fungus that grows on tree trunks or decaying logs","[Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) reconstructed &ast;_bataŋ_ ‘trunk, stalk, stick’, but the glosses in attested languages suggest a far richer and more nuanced set of meanings.  In its most literal sense [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_bataŋ_ evidently referred to the trunk of a tree, whether standing or fallen, or to the corresponding lighter structure in a woody or non-woody plant (the stem or stalk).  From this botanical sense the meaning ‘body’ was derived by extension to the world of animals, in much the same way that English refers to the main portion of the human body as the ‘trunk’.  Because of its shape the meaning ‘tree trunk’ apparently was also used as a numeral classifier for cylindrical objects, although contact influence from [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326)cannot be ruled out as an explanation for the attested distribution of &ast;_bataŋ_ in this sense.  


Several additional meanings can be assigned to [Proto-Western Malayo-Polynesian](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) or to lower-order proto-languages.  Some of these may have been present in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081), but cannot be retrieved from the available lexicographical resources for [CEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19074) languages, which in general are less numerous and less detailed than sources for the demographically more important languages of western Indonesia and the Philippines.  These additional meanings include ‘corpse’, ‘bridge of the nose’, ‘most important or preeminent thing’, ‘main course of a river’, ‘mushroom or bracket fungus that grows on tree trunks or decaying logs’, and possibly ‘bridge’.  Rather than treating some or all of these meanings as evidence for homophonous bases, it seems clear that they all derive from the notion of ‘trunk’.  Just as &ast;_bataŋ_ ‘body’ represents an extension of a botanical structure to a living human or animal, so &ast;_bataŋ_ ‘corpse’ represents an extension of the notion ‘fallen tree, log’ to a dead human or animal.  


Similarly, the meaning ‘body’ was extended to the notion ‘self’, and the concrete meaning ‘trunk’ to the abstract sense ‘most important or preeminent thing’ (the central element in a tree being the trunk, from which the branches sprout).  Reflexes of &ast;_bataŋ_ ‘bridge of the nose’ are confined to languages of the southern Philippines, Borneo (including [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432)), and  [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) , but are consistent in comparing the ridge or upper line of the nose to a tree trunk (the literal sense of a log bridge across a river can be included if we are allowed to compare [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660) _wataŋan_ ‘tree trunk (as bridge)’, with reflexes of &ast;_bataŋ_ ‘bridge’ in several languages of the Lesser Sundas).  In the absence of further evidence the agreement of [Simalur](LanguageTable#cldf:415) _bataŋ pinaŋ_ ‘a weaving model or design’ with [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245) _bataŋan_ ‘shape, figure, model’ cannot be be further clarified.



Perhaps the most striking metaphorical usage of &ast;_bataŋ_ is its application to the main course of a river, which can be seen as the ‘trunk’, from which the tributary ‘branches’ spring (although the directionality of movement is opposite in the two domains, since tributary streams flow  _into_ the ‘trunk’ rather than growing out from it).  Finally, a number of WMP reflexes of &ast;_bataŋ_ refer to mushrooms or other types of fungi, and where sufficient information is available these appear to be types of saprophytes that grow either on the trunks of living trees, or perhaps more commonly, on decaying logs.



By contrast with &ast;_bataŋ_, with which it is possible to associate a number of distinct but interrelated glosses, reflexes of &ast;_bataŋ-an_ are highly disparate.  For [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:19083) it appears possible to posit &ast;_bataŋ-an_ ‘floor girders of a house’, but no gloss can be assigned to earlier forms of this affixed word.",dempwolff193438

Ever since [Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) proposed it, &ast;_baTuk_ ‘skull’ has been problematic.  [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_batu_ ‘head’ can clearly be justified on the basis of reflexes that are widespread in the Solomons and Vanuatu, but reflexes in [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) languages do not agree in meaning, and reflexes in [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076) languages invariably occur with a reflex of &ast;_qulu_ ‘head’, raising the prospect that the second element derives from &ast;_batu_ ‘stone’.  [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_qulu_ evidently was retained in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) in the same meaning, even though most reflexes are associated with derivative meanings (headwaters of a river, above, first, etc.).",dempwolff193438

The reference to eggs in connection with a reflex of &ast;_batu_ in [Pazeh](LanguageTable#cldf:375) and [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427), and to pupil of the eye in [Favorlang/Babuza](LanguageTable#cldf:19018) and [Maori](LanguageTable#cldf:330) is best attributed to convergence.  A more intriguing agreement that is also almost certainly convergent is the use of a reflex of &ast;_batu_ as a numeral classifier in [Tombonuwo](LanguageTable#cldf:19188) of eastern Sabah, and [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325) of south Sulawesi, where it evidently has taken over the functions covered by [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_buaq_, and reflexes of this form in many of the modern languages.  [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _batu_ ‘numeral classifier for teeth’ and [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314) _batu_ ‘tooth (fig.)’ raises the possibility that this innovation may have involved a transfer of functions formerly covered by &ast;_buaq_ to reflexes of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_batu_ ‘numeral classifier for teeth’ that was lost in the great majority of attested languages and so cannot now be securely reconstructed.  



Other likely products of convergence are [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) _bato-bato_ ‘grouper, fam.  _Serrranidae’_, [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _ikan batu_ ‘sea bream:  _Proteracanthus sarissophorus_’, [Simalur](LanguageTable#cldf:415) _fatu_ ‘a seafish’, and [Toqabaqita](LanguageTable#cldf:19197) _iqa fau_ ‘boxfish:  _Ostracion sebae_,’ the forms that refer to various types of amulets or talismans in  [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276), [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432), [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) and [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947), and possibly the [Sundanese](LanguageTable#cldf:418) and [Maori](LanguageTable#cldf:330) forms assigned to [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_quzan batu_ ‘hail’.  On the other hand, constructions like &ast;_batu papan_  (lit. ‘plank stone’) are more difficult to account for as convergent developments, and it must be assumed that such stones were valued for some purpose, or else it would be difficult to explain why they were distinctively named.  



A number of languages in island Southeast Asia have borrowed [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _batu berani_ ‘magnet’; in many cases this is apparent from irregularities in the sound correspondences, as with [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _batu balániʔ_, [Aklanon](LanguageTable#cldf:226) _bató_ _balániʔ_, [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) _batu_ _baláni_, [Mansaka](LanguageTable#cldf:825) _bato barani_, [Tiruray](LanguageTable#cldf:433) _batew barani_, [Tausug](LanguageTable#cldf:18831) _batu balani_, [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325) _batu barani_  ‘lodestone, magnet’, but [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245) _batu bogani_ ‘magnet’ appears to be native.  I assume that this form is also a [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) loan, but has been reshaped by the substitution of a native reflex of &ast;_baRani_.  



Many languages have also borrowed [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _batu_ in the meaning ‘milestone; mile’, for marking travel distances, as with [Mapun](LanguageTable#cldf:19176) _batu_ ‘kilometer; marker along the road for counting kilometers (made from cement or wood)’, [Lun Dayeh](LanguageTable#cldf:19418) _batuh_ ‘a mile’, [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276) _batu_ ‘milestone; mile’



It is likely that various types of stone (limestone, pumice, etc.) were designated by [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_batu_ plus a qualifying term, but the details of such constructions cannot be reconstructed on the basis of currently available data.



There are also scattered references to the meaning ‘slave’ in association with an apparent reflex of &ast;_batu_, as with [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) _batu ni ruma_ (lit. ‘stone of the house’) ‘a slave that has been in the house since the time of one’s grandfather (coarse expression)’, [Sangir](LanguageTable#cldf:402) _batu-m-balane_ ‘slaves’ and [Bare'e](LanguageTable#cldf:236) _watua_ ‘slave’.

The alternative view --- that &ast;_bawaŋ_ was found in [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:19083) in the meaning posited here --- could be revolutionary, since it would imply that terraced pondfields were already used by the Proto-Philippine language community for agricultural purposes, an interpretation which is totally inconsistent with the view of [Keesing (1962)](Source#cldf:keesing1962), and one that suggests an earlier development even than that proposed by [Reid (1994)](bib-Reid).  A clear research priority in connection with this form is to search for cognates in other Philippine languages, as a third witness which supports the same inference would virtually eliminate convergence as a serious explanation.",keesing1962

The known distribution of this cognate set clearly is due in part to borrowing from [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326). In particular, it is striking how reflexes south of the Philippines invariably have or reflect an earlier _–r_.  However, borrowing cannot be the explanation for the entire set of related forms since _–d_ in Philippine languages would not be expected from a [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) loanword with a final liquid, nor would final /_r_/ in most languages of western Indonesia be expected from a loanword with final /_d_/.

Since brideprice is a set of economic arrangements between the families or descent groups involved in a marriage, the gloss ‘to buy’ for this form is best seen as an imposition upon an earlier economic order based on exchange by a later one based on purchase.  


Moreover, since there is good reason to believe that the [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) socio-political order was based on matrilateral cross-cousin marriage, or asymmetric exchange ([Blust 1980a](Source#cldf:blust1980), [Blust 1993](Source#cldf:blust1993)), it appears likely that &ast;_beli_ referred in particular to that category of ‘masculine’ goods which counter-circulated with the circulation of women in the formation of marriage-based alliances.  The generalization of a meaning ‘marriage prestations’ to that of purchase through a common medium of exchange would have followed naturally with the adoption of a money economy, hence the widespread semantic drift.  Under this interpretation the gloss of Proto-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian &ast;_poli_ would not have differed significantly from that of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_beli_, although there is little direct evidence that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) asymmetric exchange survived in Proto-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, or that Proto-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian &ast;_poli_ referred to marriage prestations.",dempwolff193438;blust1980;blust1993

Taken at face value the [Mandar](LanguageTable#cldf:813) and [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) forms support a [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) reconstruction with mid-front penultimate vowel.  However, [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) as reconstructed to date has only four vowels: &ast;_i_, &ast;_u_, &ast;_e_ (schwa), &ast;_a_.  Since the schwa normally became [Mandar](LanguageTable#cldf:813) /_a_/ in the penult, and [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_o_ in all positions, it cannot have been the penultimate vowel in this form, leaving us to conclude that the similarity of the [Mandar](LanguageTable#cldf:813) and [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) words in both shape and meaning is a particularly striking coincidence.  Finally, the semantic evolution of this form from ‘coconut husk’ to ‘rubbish’ and even ‘excrement’ seems to have followed a natural path determined by the almost daily use of coconuts: the nut cannot be used for meat or milk unless the husk is first removed, and this is most commonly discarded as refuse, since only a small percentage of the many husks that are removed would be needed for cordage and the like.",

29894,*beNbeN,b,banana: Musa sapientum L.,"Based on [Basai](LanguageTable#cldf:19171), [Trobiawan](LanguageTable#cldf:19209) _puti_ ‘banana’ and cognates in Malayo-Polynesian languages reaching as far east as Fiji [Wolff (2010)](Source#cldf:wolff2010) suggests that only [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_puti_ can be reconstructed in the meaning ‘banana’.  This inference runs against the observation that reflexes of &ast;_beNbeN_ are found in at least some members of every primary branch of Austronesian that is represented in Taiwan (Atayalic, Northwest Formosan, Western Plains, [Bunun](LanguageTable#cldf:250), Tsouic, [Rukai](LanguageTable#cldf:397), [Puyuma](LanguageTable#cldf:386), [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370), East Formosan), making this a far stronger candidate.



It must be kept in mind that the Spanish were present in the Taipei basis from 1626-1642, and left loanwords such as _baka_ ‘cow’ (< Span. _vaca_) and _paskua_ ‘New Year’s Day’ (< Span. _Pascua_ ‘Easter’) in [Kavalan](LanguageTable#cldf:293). Since the Spanish came to Taiwan from Manila and almost certainly brought Filipinos with them, the typical Malayo-Polynesian words for ‘banana’ in [Basai](LanguageTable#cldf:19171) and [Trobiawan](LanguageTable#cldf:19209) probably are best attributed to borrowing of a form like [Pangasinan](LanguageTable#cldf:920) _punti_ ‘banana’.  Alternatively (since reflexes of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_punti_ are rare in the Philippines, and absent from [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423)), it is conceivable that both &ast;_beNbeN_ and &ast;_puti_ were found in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072), the first as a generic term for _Musa_ spp. and the second as the designation for a particular banana species or variety that expanded its field of reference and acquired a preconsonantal medial nasal in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081). As with other reduplicated monosyllables, it is assumed that the medial consonant cluster in this word was broken up by schwa epenthesis in the separate histories of several Formosan languages, a hypothesis that is further supported by the occurrence of a word-final schwa in [Rukai](LanguageTable#cldf:397) and the Tsouic languages [Kanakanabu](LanguageTable#cldf:680) and [Saaroa](LanguageTable#cldf:974), which do not permit unambiguous final consonants.",wolff2010

[Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) reconstructed &ast;_beRas_ ‘husked rice’.  Although the great majority of reflexes specify ‘husked rice’ as the referent of this term, a few give ‘unhusked rice’ ([Itbayaten](LanguageTable#cldf:282), [Hiligaynon](LanguageTable#cldf:623)).  This difference probably is more apparent than real, given the potential ambiguity in the English term ‘unhusked’ (1. negative of ‘husked’, 2. past of ‘unhusk’).  What is clear is that &ast;_beRas_ referred to rice that has been harvested but not yet cooked, evidently without respect to whether it has been pounded to remove the husk.  However, since harvested rice would remain unhusked for a very short time prior to storage, and would remain in storage prior to cooking for a considerably longer period, it is reasonable to suppose that the more common referent of &ast;_beRas_ would be rice in the latter state. 


Reflexes in several widely separated [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) languages support the reconstruction of additional meanings, including (1) ‘fruit; fruitful’ ([Isneg](LanguageTable#cldf:647), [Bontok](LanguageTable#cldf:246), [Manobo (Western Bukidnon)](LanguageTable#cldf:819), [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314), [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427), [Dairi-Pakpak Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18147)), (2) ‘seed, pit’ ([Bontok](LanguageTable#cldf:246), [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314), [Manggarai](LanguageTable#cldf:816)), (3) ‘pimples that resemble rice grains’ -- a term that apparently referred to an affliction of pigs ([Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252), [Nias](LanguageTable#cldf:361), [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947), [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325)), (4) ‘hail’ ([Isneg](LanguageTable#cldf:647), [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427)), and probably (5) ‘testicles’ ([Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314), and [Hanunóo](LanguageTable#cldf:273) _búgas_ ‘scrotum’ next to _bugás_ ‘husked rice’, with accent shift to distinguish meanings that originated as one, but subsequently required separation).

The glosses in several languages cited here suggest that &ast;_beRay_ referred specifically to the giving of gifts, hence to giving as a social act, rather than to the simple physical act of passing an object from one person to another.  The glosses for [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) _bugáy_ and [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276) _beriʔ_ suggest further that by at least [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) times &ast;_beRay_ applied to the socially binding exchange of gifts in a marriage transaction.",

In addition to its literal meaning (‘heavy’) it appears likely from the agreement of usages in both [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) and [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076) languages that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_beReqat_ also had several figurative meanings, most notably ‘difficult, burdensome’ and ‘pregnant’.",

Three general morphological observations are of some interest in connection with this form: (1) The analysis of [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) _veŋin_, [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) _borŋin_ and similar forms with _-n_ remains unclear.  If &ast;_-n_ was a suffix it evidently was unique or very rare, and its function obscure (if from &ast;_beRŋi-en_, the suffixal vowel has irregularly dropped). Alternatively, we could posit a doublet, but this appears unsatisfactory in view of the likelihood that &ast;_beRŋi_ appeared in a number of different expressions, some of which almost certainly involved affixation, (2) evidence from both [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) and [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) languages suggests that this word sometimes occurred with the 3sg possessive suffix: [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) _&ast;beRŋi-ni-a_, [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_poŋi-ña_.  [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_poŋi_ thus took the marking for ‘inalienable’ possession (like body parts, kin terms, the words for ‘name’, ‘shadow/soul’ and the like).  (3) internal Polynesian evidence suggests that the irregular change observed in PPn &ast;_pō_ ‘night’ probably resulted by back-formation from &ast;_poŋi-a_ ‘be overcome by night’ (to &ast;&ast;_po-ŋia_, with automatic moraic extension of the new monosyllabic content word &ast;&ast;_po_ to &ast;&ast;_pō_).  If so, [Maori](LanguageTable#cldf:330) _pōŋi-a_ ‘be overtaken by night, benighted’ represents an analogical extension of the lengthened vowel to a morphological context in which it did not originally occur.  


With regard to meaning, it is clear from usages in both [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) and [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) languages that this term had multiple functions.  In addition to designating ‘night’ (opposite of day), &ast;_beRŋi_ marked the 24-hour unit used in counting ‘days’ (hence ‘how many days?’, ‘three days ago’, ‘three days hence’, etc.), and evidently figured in the expression for ‘tomorrow’ (‘day after tomorrow’, etc.; ‘yesterday’, however, was expressed with &ast;_ñeRab_ or its doublet _ñiRab_).  As noted by [Pawley (1979)](bib-Pawley), [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_poŋi_ probably was used in conjunction with &ast;_panua_ in some time expressions.  Finally, [Bikol](LanguageTable#cldf:244) _sa baŋgí_ ‘at night, in the evening’, [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285) _sa beŋi_ ‘all night long, one whole night’ are assumed to reflect different proclitic elements (&ast;_sa_ ‘locative’ vs. the clitic form of &ast;_esa_ ‘one’).",
25351,*beRsay,b,canoe paddle; paddle a canoe,"Also [Casiguran Dumagat](LanguageTable#cldf:569) _busay_ ‘canoe paddle; to paddle a canoe’, [Kelabit](LanguageTable#cldf:299) _besay_ ‘canoe paddle’, [Sasak](LanguageTable#cldf:404) _bose_ ‘oar, paddle; to row, to paddle’, [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245) _bose_ ‘to row (used in song language in place of _botoi_)’, [Banggai](LanguageTable#cldf:238) _bosi_ ‘paddle; to paddle; travel over sea’, [Buginese](LanguageTable#cldf:239) _wise_ ‘a paddle’; _m-pise_ ‘to paddle’; _pab-bise_ ‘person who paddles’, [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325) _bise_ ‘paddle, oar’; _am-mise_ ‘to paddle, to row’, [Wetan](LanguageTable#cldf:1118) _wei_ ‘paddle’, [Tanga](LanguageTable#cldf:425) _fis_ ‘paddle; also used to indicate a paddle stroke’, [Arosi](LanguageTable#cldf:485) _hote-hote_ ‘shoulder blade’.  


One of the basic pieces of lexical evidence for early Austronesian voyaging, &ast;_beRsay_ is phonologically notable in being one of a small set of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) lexical items that contains preconsonantal &ast;_R_. Although the medial cluster was lost in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) it clearly was retained not only in Central Philippine languages and [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573) ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094)), but also in at least two languages of extreme northeast Indonesia, notably [Arguni](LanguageTable#cldf:483) ([CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076)?) and [Numfor](LanguageTable#cldf:364) ([South Halmahera-West New Guinea](LanguageTable#cldf:20002)).  Due to the number of sometimes highly specific environments governing conditioned changes in [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372) it is not always easy to determine the regularity of a change in this language.  I assume that [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372) _besós_ reflects &ast;_beRsay_, with (1) a medial epenthetic shwa which, being penultimate, secondarily acquired the stress (&ast;_beRésay_), and (2) a change &ast;_s_ to _s_ (for anticipated &ast;&ast;_t_) which was either conditioned by the presence of a preceding _s_, or which shows a sporadic assimilation to it.",

Despite the lexicographical inadequacies of the [Bugotu](LanguageTable#cldf:248) and [Nggela](LanguageTable#cldf:359) glosses (which confuse the native hornbill with an Amazonian bird also conspicuous for its prominent beak), it is clear that [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_mpinam_ replaced [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_kalaw_ in the meaning ‘hornbill’.",

Given the apparently irregular loss of the first syllable in [Uma](LanguageTable#cldf:19170) (central Sulawesi) _naŋa_, it is possible that such a disyllabic variant also existed (in place names?) by [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) times.",dempwolff193438;mills1975[949]

In terms of the larger set of reconstructed vocabulary connected with early Austronesian rice culture we can thus say that the &ast;_pajay_ (rice in the field) when harvested became either &ast;_beRas_ (destined for cooking and consumption) or &ast;_bineSiq_ (destined for planting).",

This comparison, its doublet &ast;_binti_, and the irregular forms just cited together provide evidence for a sporting contest which must have been practiced in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) society (hence circa 5000 BP). It is clear that it was a game of men and boys, and that in its basic form one contestant planted his legs firmly while the other attempted to dislodge him with a shin-kick to the back of the calf. Contestants apparently alternated as attacker until one was either knocked off balance or conceded as a result of inability to endure the pain.  The glosses in [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276), [Sundanese](LanguageTable#cldf:418)  and [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947) suggest that &ast;_bintiq_ also applied to the manner of attack typical of fowls, and raise the possibility that the game may have been invented as an imitation of cockfighting (which, therefore, must also have been present in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) society).

I take ‘WZH’ to be the unmarked meaning of ‘the husband of one's sister-in-law’ (reflecting a male point of view), although ‘HZH’ is also available.

Although it is not immediately obvious that the two sets are connected, [Paul J-K Li (p.c.)](bib-Paul)  informs me that the exceptionally large, smooth leaves of _Alocasia_ were commonly used in the past as food wrappers among both aboriginal peoples and Minnan Chinese.  If we are dealing with a single cognate set, then, the original specific reference to _Alocasia_ appears to have been all but completely lost in most [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) languages; if ‘leaf wrapper’ was part of the gloss of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_biRaq_ it evidently was completely lost in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081).

Like the fronds of several other palms _Licuala_ leaves evidently were used as thatch, but because of their unusual structure they also served as umbrellas.

As with its doublet &ast;_beties_, the fundamental referent of this form appears to have been the leg between the knee and ankle.  However, the perceptually most salient part of the lower leg evidently is the calf muscle, indicated by [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_buaq ni bities_.  Like other perceptually salient members of larger semantic categories to which they belong (e.g. &ast;_sawa_ ‘python’, some reflexes of which evolved into the generic term for ‘snake’), the notion ‘calf of the leg’ came to usurp the more fundamental sense ‘lower leg’ in many languages.  When this happened reflexes of &ast;_beties_ or &ast;_bities_ without the modifier &ast;_buaq_ took on the sense ‘calf of the leg’, and could be used themselves as modifiers roughly equivalent to &ast;_buaq_ (e.g. [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) _bitis ni taŋa_ ‘muscles of the lower arm’ next to [Acehnese](LanguageTable#cldf:225) _bòh pisaŋ_ ‘muscles of the upper arm’).",

The fundamental idea represented by this form, and by the root which it contains, is that of an abrupt recoiling or springing motion, as that of a released snare trap, the motion of a flicking finger or the sudden jumping movement of a shrimp or grasshopper.  By [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) times the term apparently was also used to designate snare traps; whether this was equally the case in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) remains somewhat less clear.  It is noteworthy that a number of [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) languages agree in reflecting the ""fortis grade"" of [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_p_ in this form, and that such [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076) languages as [Selaru](LanguageTable#cldf:409) and [Buruese](LanguageTable#cldf:251) show an unexplained _b_ rather than the normally spirantized reflex of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_b_ ([Selaru](LanguageTable#cldf:409) _h_, [Buruese](LanguageTable#cldf:251) _f_).

The [Buli](LanguageTable#cldf:249) word appears to be a loan, thus raising the possibility that [Numfor](LanguageTable#cldf:364) _biser_ is also borrowed.  If so this reconstruction must be reassigned to [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:19083), and due recognition given to the existence of Philippine loanwords in [South Halmahera-West New Guinea](LanguageTable#cldf:20002) languages (presumably as a result of the pre-European spice trade linking Brunei to the northern Moluccas).",

The [Rotuman](LanguageTable#cldf:394) and Polynesian reflexes of &ast;_bituqen_ show a sporadic lowering of the first vowel and what appears to be regressive assimilation of the last vowel (expected &ast;&ast;_o_), almost certainly as the result of a single innovation. Other types of irregularities appear in [Motu](LanguageTable#cldf:345) _hisiu_ ‘star’, and in the Micronesian reflexes cited here, and it is possible that the [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) reflex of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_bituqen_ was &ast;_pituqun_ rather than &ast;_pituqon_.  [Dahl (1976)](Source#cldf:dahl1976) interprets the unexpected last vowel of [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) _vitjuqan_ as evidence that &ast;_bituqen_ contained a base morpheme &ast;_bituq_ which could be suffixed either with &ast;_-an_ or &ast;_-en_.  This argument would be considerably enhanced if at least some comparative evidence were presented for a simple base &ast;_bituq_, but such evidence has not been forthcoming.  Moreover, the proposal that a base meaning ‘star’ could be suffixed with &ast;_-an_ or &ast;_-en_ is itself open to question.

Given the probable reflex of &ast;_buaq_ in [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432) _voa-lavo_ ‘species of rat’ it is likely that the otherwise unexplained initial syllable of [Melanau (Mukah)](LanguageTable#cldf:349) _belabaw_ ‘rat’ is a phonologically reduced form of &ast;_buaq_; if so the similar syllable in _belaŋaw_ ‘housefly’ (&ast;_laŋaw_) and _belawaʔ_ ‘spider’ (&ast;_lawaq_) presumably is to be explained in the same way.  


[PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_buaq_ is one of the most fundamental Austronesian comparisons, and its denotation clearly encompassed the notion ‘fruit’, but its precise meaning remains poorly defined.  Although [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) reflexes point to the meaning ‘fruit’, in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) the general reference to ‘fruit’ appears to have been signaled by &ast;_buaq ni kahiw_ (&ast;_buaq_ of a tree). At the same time various other affixed, compounded or reduplicated forms of &ast;_buaq_ had different referents, thus pointing to a more abstract sense for &ast;_buaq_ than ‘fruit’.  Distributional evidence favors the association of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_buaq_ alone or in composition with at least the following glosses: 


1. fruit (almost universal), 2. areca palm and nut (almost universal from the northern Philippines to the Southeast Solomons), 3. grain ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094), [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076)), 4. berry ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094), [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082)), 5. seed ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094), [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076), [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082)), 6. nut ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094), [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082)), 7. endosperm of a sprouting coconut ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094), [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082)), 8. kidney ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094), [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076), [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082)), 9. heart ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094), [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076), [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082)), 10. finger ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094), [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076)), 11. calf of the leg ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094), [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076), [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082)), 12. testicle ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094), [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076), [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082)), 13. various insects ([Kelabit](LanguageTable#cldf:299), [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432), [Sika](LanguageTable#cldf:414)), 14. scar tissue ([Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947), [Manggarai](LanguageTable#cldf:816)), 15. roe ([Acehnese](LanguageTable#cldf:225), [Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434) ), 16.  bud ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094), [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082)), 17. flower/blossom ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094), [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082)), 18. to bear fruit ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094), [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076), [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082)), 19. words, speech or songs ([Rhade](LanguageTable#cldf:956), [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276)?, [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Sasak](LanguageTable#cldf:404), [Wolio](LanguageTable#cldf:1124), [Tetun](LanguageTable#cldf:1060), [Nukuoro](LanguageTable#cldf:363), [Rennellese](LanguageTable#cldf:390), [Hawaiian](LanguageTable#cldf:620)), 20. meaning, contents of discussion ([Dairi-Pakpak Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18147), [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947), [Manggarai](LanguageTable#cldf:816)).  In addition to these glosses several others can be assocated with [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) &ast;_buaq_, including 21. buttock ([Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947)), 22. Adam's apple ([Acehnese](LanguageTable#cldf:225), [Sasak](LanguageTable#cldf:404)), 23. nipple of the breast ([Kayan](LanguageTable#cldf:294), [Sangir](LanguageTable#cldf:402), [Tontemboan](LanguageTable#cldf:19052)), 24. button ([Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Acehnese](LanguageTable#cldf:225), [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314), [Sasak](LanguageTable#cldf:404)), 25. marble ([Melanau (Mukah)](LanguageTable#cldf:349), [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Nias](LanguageTable#cldf:361)) and 26. some still undefined connection with tattooing ([Kayan](LanguageTable#cldf:294), [Mentawai](LanguageTable#cldf:335), possibly [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276)).  



The following points are noteworthy: 



1) [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_buaq_ formed the head of many head-attribute constructions which functioned as the names of particular fruits (&ast;_buaq kuluR_ ‘breadfruit’, &ast;_buaq niuR_ ‘coconut’, &ast;_buaq pahuq_ ‘mango’, &ast;_buaq punti_ ‘banana’, etc.). It is likely that the same was true of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072), although the available [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) evidence is scanty, 



2) [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_buaq_ almost certainly functioned in addition as a numeral classifier which applied to roundish or fruit-like objects (the [Sangir](LanguageTable#cldf:402) and [Rembong](LanguageTable#cldf:391) usages evidently are innovative).  This inference is supported by evidence from a number of [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) languages, including [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276), [Rhade](LanguageTable#cldf:956), [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Acehnese](LanguageTable#cldf:225), and [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314), a number of [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076) languages, including [Sika](LanguageTable#cldf:414), [Kambera](LanguageTable#cldf:678), [Hawu](LanguageTable#cldf:405), [Tetun](LanguageTable#cldf:1060), [Asilulu](LanguageTable#cldf:18016) (?), [Alune](LanguageTable#cldf:471) and [Kamarian](LanguageTable#cldf:288), and a number of [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) languages, including [Arosi](LanguageTable#cldf:485), [Woleaian](LanguageTable#cldf:443), [Rennellese](LanguageTable#cldf:390), [Nukuoro](LanguageTable#cldf:363) and [Tuvaluan](LanguageTable#cldf:19417) (also see [Pawley 1972:35-36](Source#cldf:pawley1972)).  
The referents of &ast;_buaq_ as a numeral classifier included houses ([Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276), [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Kambera](LanguageTable#cldf:678)), villages ([Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Kamarian](LanguageTable#cldf:288)), beads ([Kankanaey](LanguageTable#cldf:289), [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432), [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Bare'e](LanguageTable#cldf:236), [Tetun](LanguageTable#cldf:1060), [Hawaiian](LanguageTable#cldf:620)), stones ([Kankanaey](LanguageTable#cldf:289), [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Arosi](LanguageTable#cldf:485)), eggs ([Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Rhade](LanguageTable#cldf:956), [Acehnese](LanguageTable#cldf:225), [Hawu](LanguageTable#cldf:405), [Tetun](LanguageTable#cldf:1060), [Alune](LanguageTable#cldf:471), [Arosi](LanguageTable#cldf:485), [Rennellese](LanguageTable#cldf:390)), and mountains ([Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Kamarian](LanguageTable#cldf:288)).  It is noteworthy that other candidates for numeral classifiers are yet to be identified, placing the weight of the inference that classifiers were used in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) entirely on &ast;_buaq_, 



3) most [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) and [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076) reflexes support an inference that the meanings ‘fruit’ and ‘areca nut’ were associated with the same morpheme, but the [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) evidence suggests that there were two homophonous morphemes.  I assume that one morpheme expressed both meanings, but that in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) these meanings become disassociated and connected respectively with oral and nasal grade reflexes of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_buaq_ ([POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_puaq_ ‘fruit’, &ast;_mpuaq_ ‘betel nut’).  One [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076) language (Tetum) also has distinct phonological reflexes for each meaning, but this observation is taken to be unrelated to the facts in [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) languages, 



4) the use of a reflex of &ast;_buaq_ as a classifier for bullets is fairly widespread ([Rhade](LanguageTable#cldf:956), [Dairi-Pakpak Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18147), [Tetun](LanguageTable#cldf:1060), [Rennellese](LanguageTable#cldf:390)) and is, of course, a product of convergent semantic development. Likewise, despite the accessibility of the referent in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) times, distributional evidence suggests that the meaning ‘endosperm of a sprouting coconut’ in association with a reflex of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_buaq_ was independently innovated in PGreater Central Philippine  and [Bwaidoga/Bwaidoka](LanguageTable#cldf:19016).",pawley1972[35-36]

However, the meanings of the [Sangir](LanguageTable#cldf:402), [Wolio](LanguageTable#cldf:1124), and especially the [Puluwat](LanguageTable#cldf:385) words suggest a relationship to &ast;_buhat_₃ (in the sense of ‘bring, carry; cargo’).  The glosses of Sulawesian forms such as [Sangir](LanguageTable#cldf:402) _maḷa-wuaʔ_ and [Wolio](LanguageTable#cldf:1124) _buat-aka_ further raise the possibility that &ast;_buat_ referred to the offering of first fruits.",

 Reflexes of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_bubu_ are among the most persistent words which refer to a cultural artefact.  The &ast;_bubu_ trap shows small variations in form and function in its wide distribution from Taiwan to Madagascar to Fiji and indeed, several variants are often found in individual cultures.  The basic form, however, is that of a wickerwork basket made of bamboo, about one meter long and roughly conical in shape, with a smaller conical entrance of converging bamboo splints (illustrated, e.g. in [Fey 1986:98](Source#cldf:fey1986)).  Within the ethnographic present such traps were generally placed in the mouths of rivers or in the sea near the shore, baited and sometimes weighted with stones to keep them below water and prevent them from drifting.  Fish or eels which entered to take the bait were able to slip through the converging splints of the trap mouth, but could not exit.  Larger and structurally more complex varieties contained two or more compartments, each entered in the same way through successively more restrictive openings which culminated in a cul-de-sac ([PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) &ast;_bunuq-an_) from which the fish were ultimately collected.  


Traps of the same general type were also traditionally used in other parts of the world, including west Africa, western Europe, and among various Eskimo groups.  This comparison provides evidence for an important fishing implement which must have been used by speakers of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) on Taiwan, and subsequently carried by speakers of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) and its descendants throughout island Southeast Asia (including Madagascar) and the Pacific.

Although [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_bubuŋ_ apparently was a partial reduplication, in a few scattered languages ([Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314), [Bare'e](LanguageTable#cldf:236), [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325)) it has been reinterpreted as a full reduplication, perhaps through contamination with &ast;_buŋbuŋ_ ‘swell up, rise’.  [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) appears to have retained a reflex only of the suffixed form (&ast;_pupuŋan_), and like many other trisyllabic words which contained a reduplicated first syllable this form sometimes lost the initial syllable in conformity with a general disyllabic canonical target ([Blust 1977a](Source#cldf:blust1977)). In some languages of the _Southeast Solomons_  the resulting form came to be obligatorily possessed, as is typical of many part-to-whole relationships, thereby acquiring an optional or obligatory 3sg. suffix _-na_.  It is clear that by at least [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) times houses were made with with a central ridgepole, producing a gabled roof.  Whether &ast;_bubuŋ_ referred to the ridge of the roof as a general structural feature, or specifically to the ridgepole (or both) is unclear, although the latter may have been specified as &ast;_kahiw ni bubuŋ_ (cf. e.g. [Buli](LanguageTable#cldf:249) _pupuŋ-an ni ai_).  Similarly, although both &ast;_bubuŋ_ and &ast;_bubuŋ-an_ are widely reflected, it is unknown how (or if) they differed in meaning, despite some suggestive semantic distinctions such as that in [Ifugaw](LanguageTable#cldf:636) between _búbuŋ_ ‘outside roof ridge’ and _ambubúŋ-an_ ‘inside roof ridge’.  



As a general rule reflexes of &ast;_bubuŋ_ appear to refer more often to the ridge of the roof, and reflexes of &ast;_bubuŋ-an_ to the roof as a whole (lit. ‘place of the ridge’).  Although this correlation is very imperfect it receives some support from the fact that no other monosememic term appears to be available for ‘roof’, the only other candidate (&ast;_qatep_) meaning both ‘roof’ and ‘thatch’.  As with &ast;_qatep_, &ast;_bubuŋ_ evidently referred both to the ridge of the roof and to the thatch that covered it (reflexes in several Philippine languages, [Acehnese](LanguageTable#cldf:225), [Simalur](LanguageTable#cldf:415), [Sasak](LanguageTable#cldf:404), [Bare'e](LanguageTable#cldf:236), [Rembong](LanguageTable#cldf:391) and [Rotuman](LanguageTable#cldf:394)), and in this respect it differs sharply from &ast;_bubuŋ-an_, reflexes of which rarely if ever specify the thatch as opposed to the ridge of the roof, or the roof as a whole.  In addition it appears that &ast;_bubuŋ_ was used for the decks of boats ([Mentawai](LanguageTable#cldf:335), [Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434)) and for natural ridges on hills or mountains (several languages of Mindanao, [Balinese](LanguageTable#cldf:235), [Bare'e](LanguageTable#cldf:236), [Yamdena](LanguageTable#cldf:1130), [Nggela](LanguageTable#cldf:359), [Ulawa](LanguageTable#cldf:1095)).",blust1977

This term appears to have represented both the idea of a temporary interference with vision caused by a mote in the eye, and the more permanent condition of blindness.  Only the latter meaning is known to have persisted in [PCEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19074).  A lexically encoded distinction between blindness in one eye and blindness in both eyes is common to a number of Austronesian languages, and can be reconstructed for [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) (as &ast;_picek_, &ast;_buta_ respectively).  Although no reconstruction is yet possible, the agreement of a number of languages in having a ready-made expression ‘blind and deaf’ suggests that a similar standard collocation existed in [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) .",

Although evidence for the unaffixed base is scanty, it seems clear that [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) distinguished &ast;_puput_ and &ast;_puput-i_.  In accordance with a widespread drift toward a disyllabic canonical target in [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) languages which incidentally produced a correlation between reduplication and intransitivity ([Blust 1977a](Source#cldf:blust1977)), reflexes of &ast;_puput-i_ have often lost the initial syllable by haplology.  Once this change occurred the same canonical pressure produced a tendency to reinterpret the suffix as part of the base, allowing further suffixation on top of the morphologically incorporated &ast;_-i_ in [Fijian](LanguageTable#cldf:266) and the Polynesian languages.  By this point the surviving remnants of the unreduced base were reinterpreted as partial reduplications (e.g. [Hawaiian](LanguageTable#cldf:620) _huhuki_, cited by [Pukui and Elbert (1971)](bib-Pukui) as a reduplication of _huki_, whereas historically the latter actually is a reduction of the former).  A similar change evidently operated to some extent in the languages of eastern Indonesia, although the pattern is less well-attested, and did not lead to the CVCVC = intransitive, CVC-i = transitive correlation characteristic of many [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) languages.

Although &ast;_buCuq_ is often reflected in the meaning ‘penis’, it is clear that this meaning was represented by [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_qutiN_.  Both [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) and non-[Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004)  witnesses agree in supporting &ast;_buCuq_ ‘testicles’, but two observations suggest that this semantic inference may be incomplete.  


First, [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_qateluR_, &ast;_qiteluR_ evidently meant both ‘egg’ and ‘testicle’.  


Second, an affixed form of [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) &ast;_butuq_ apparently also meant ‘to castrate animals’.  


With regard to the first observation it is possible that &ast;_qateluR_, &ast;_qiteluR_ differed from &ast;_butuq_ only in being more figurative.  However, reflexes of the latter term are often noted as vulgar or otherwise inappropriate to humans.  Together with references to castration, then, this observation suggests that &ast;_butuq_ referred primarily or exclusively to the testicles of animals, and only jokularly or crudely to those of humans.  Since comparative evidence supporting such a distinction is still lacking in the [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) languages, [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_buCuq_ must be reconstructed with the meaning ‘testicles (of both humans and animals)’.  It follows that a lexical differentiation arose in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) when &ast;_qateluR_, &ast;_qiteluR_ ‘egg’ was extended to include the meaning ‘testicles (of humans)’, leaving [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_butuq_ to cover a residual semantic category which was considered marked in relation to human beings.",

Although [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) _&ast;budaq_ apparently referred only to the formation of bubbles on the surface of a liquid, as from breakers crashing on the shore, or from _Derris elliptica_ when it is crushed and mixed with river water to stun fish, reflexes in [CEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19074) languages much more clearly and consistently reflect the meaning ‘bubble up, spring forth’, with reference to the effervescence of spring water (hence bubbles arising from a depth).

[PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_buhat_₂ evidently was an all-purpose verb of general action (doing, making, creating, performing, working), which also represented the nominal counterparts of these actions together with secondary senses of cause, need and benefit deriving from performative acts.  It appears to have been distinct from &ast;_buhat_₃, although both have a wide range of referents.",
25619,*buhat₃,b,"to lift, stand up, arise, emerge, begin, depart, carry; cargo; take something; take a wife","Also [Bikol](LanguageTable#cldf:244) _buwát_ ‘arise, rise, get up’, [Manobo (Western Bukidnon)](LanguageTable#cldf:819) _buwat_ ‘lift a fish weir out of the water to see if anything has been caught’, [Rotinese](LanguageTable#cldf:395) _foʔa_ ‘stand up’, [Erai](LanguageTable#cldf:263) _hua_ ‘take up’, [Sa'a](LanguageTable#cldf:18945) _huʔe_ ‘carry suspended from the head as native women carry, carry bamboo water vessels four or five at a time bound with _sikeri_ rope’.  It is possible that some of the terms which I have assigned to different etyma of the shape &ast;_buat_ or &ast;_buhat_ are actually cognate.  The network of plausible semantic connections for forms that reflect etyma of these shapes is extraordinarily complex, including (probably among other still undiscovered types) the following range of meanings: harvest fruits, ceremony at planting, do, make, create, perform, to work, deed, thing, creation, gossip, behavior/conduct, performance, work, because/on account of, through the action of, need/use, necessary, for (benefactive), stand up, arise, emerge, begin, carry, cargo, take something, take a wife.  



In using such material for semantic reconstruction one is confronted with logical relations similar to those found in dialect chaining: either the whole complex is treated as a unit with the unwanted consequence that the extremities appear to be highly distinct or even unrelated, or else more-or-less arbitrary divisions are made in the chain of glosses with the unwanted consequence that various etyma of the same shape share a partial semantic similarity (cf. the supporting evidence for &ast;_b-in-uhat-an_ under &ast;_buhat_₂, which includes material semantically more appropriate to &ast;_buhat_₃).  Even if there was a single highly polysemous [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) term &ast;_buhat_, lexicographers of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) almost certainly would have differed in how many dictionary entries they recognized, just as lexicographers of its descendants differ in the grouping of homophonous terms, (e.g. for [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) [Wolff (1972)](Source#cldf:wolff1972) includes _búhat_ ‘do something, work’ and ‘ceremony of offering something cooked with no salt to spirits to insure harvest’ under a single entry, but assigns _búhat_ ‘lift’ to another, whereas the Binukid dictionary of [Post and Gardner (1992)](bib-Post) includes _buhat_ ‘deed, act; to do, make (something), perform’ and _ka-buhat_ ‘to change, turn, transform’ under a single entry, but contrarily assigns _buhat_ ‘appease spirit deities in a rite which involves prayers, offerings of betel nut, etc., and the slaughter of pigs and chickens’ to another.  In short, there appears to be no completely satisfactory solution to this problem.",wolff1972
25622,*buhet,b,squirrel,"Also [Kavalan](LanguageTable#cldf:293) _buRut_ ‘flying squirrel’, [Bunun (Takituduh)](LanguageTable#cldf:18974) _puhut_ ‘squirrel’, [Ifugaw (Batad)](LanguageTable#cldf:18225) _buát_ ‘mouse, rat’, [Sa'a](LanguageTable#cldf:18945) _huto_ ‘cuscus, phalanger’ (under which Ivens compares [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660) _wut_ ‘squirrel’ without, however, citing a source).  Based on [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) reflexes together with [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _buʔót_ ‘rabbit’, [Bikol](LanguageTable#cldf:244) _boʔot_ ‘mountain rat’ [Tsuchida (1976:136)](Source#cldf:tsuchida1976) reconstructed &ast;_buhut_, but the majority of forms which he cites are ambiguous for last-syllable &ast;_u_ or &ast;_e_.  The reconstruction of last-syllable schwa in this form is supported by [Amis](LanguageTable#cldf:227) (Central dialect as recorded by [Fey 1986](Source#cldf:fey1986), but not the material cited by Tsuchida) and by all _Cordilleran_ witnesses.  A few languages, including [Atayal](LanguageTable#cldf:493) and [Sundanese](LanguageTable#cldf:418) show sporadic assimilation of the second vowel to the first; others, including [Puyuma](LanguageTable#cldf:386), [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370), and [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285), show the fusion of schwa with an adjacent vowel common to the historical phonology of many Austronesian languages. 


The more limited cognate set cited by Tsuchida does not permit a precise semantic reconstruction, and such misleading and inaccurate glosses as ‘marmot’ and ‘lemur’ (animals which do not occur in Southeast Asia) in some of the additional sources cited here contribute little to determining the referent of this term.  However, the agreement of [Mansaka](LanguageTable#cldf:825) _boot_ and [Sundanese](LanguageTable#cldf:418) _buut_ with [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) glosses clearly supports an inference that [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_buhet_ meant ‘squirrel’ (probably excluding ‘flying squirrel’, which is lexically distinguished in most [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) languages), and so adds one more member to the inventory of true placental mammals that can be lexically inferred as denizens of the Austronesian homeland ([Blust 1982a](Source#cldf:blust1982)).",tsuchida1976[136];fey1986;blust1982

The meaning of this term in most attested languages suggests that it was introduced only during the period of European colonial rule, yet the term itself appears to be native.

Given the evidence that [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_buaq_ ‘fruit’ ceased to function as a generic marker for fruits, and that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_buŋa_ ‘flower’ underwent a semantic shift to cover the earlier referent of &ast;_buaq_, there is a high probability that &ast;_budak_ was a [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:19083) innovation in the meaning ‘flower’.  All known referents except [Mandar](LanguageTable#cldf:813) _buraʔ_ are consistent with this interpretation, and the interpretation itself is consistent with the evidence supporting all three reconstructions.  For this reason I assume that [Mandar](LanguageTable#cldf:813) _buraʔ_ is a loan from one of the languages of northern Sulawesi. As evidence that such a basic term can be borrowed we need only consider the forms cited in this note for [Casiguran Dumagat](LanguageTable#cldf:569), [Kapampangan](LanguageTable#cldf:291), [Pangasinan](LanguageTable#cldf:920), [Hanunóo](LanguageTable#cldf:273) and [Palawan Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:247), all of which appear to be [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) loans, and many of the forms from Mindanao, which appear to be borrowed from [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) or some other Bisayan source.  Indeed, a comparable situation is seen in western Indonesia, where native terms are often used to refer to the blossoms of fructifying plants, while [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _buŋa_ has been borrowed as a term for flowers in the (modern) ornamental or decorative sense.",

The fundamental referent of &ast;_bujeq_ clearly was the effervescent surface of liquids (foam, bubbles).  By at least [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) times this term evidently also referred to the quiescent scum on stagnant liquids, and to foaming at the mouth.  From the latter usage a metaphorical extension evidently was applied to garrulous speech ([Aklanon](LanguageTable#cldf:226), [Sika](LanguageTable#cldf:414), [Fijian](LanguageTable#cldf:266)).  Finally, there is tenuous evidence ([Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432), [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947)) that a reflex of &ast;_bujeq_ applied to some type of white bead, perhaps from its similarity to a water bubble.",

All [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) languages reflect &ast;_puke_ rather than &ast;_puka_, with an idiosyncratic change.  The semantic evolution of &ast;_buka_ suggests that although this term is the translation equivalent of English ‘open’ it differed conceptually in at least one important respect.  The unmarked sense of ‘to open’ in English, as in most Indo-European  languages, involves the removal or setting aside of a structure which blocks access into a three-dimensional bounded space (e.g. the doorway or window of a house, the opening of a box or other container, the mouth).  


By contrast, reflexes of &ast;_buka_ in Austronesian languages often mean ‘open’ in the sense of ‘uncover’, ‘expose’ or ‘disclose’.  This semantic disconformity is reminiscent of the difference of ‘conceptual focus’ seen in comparing location terms such as ‘in, inside’ in Indo-European  and Austronesian languages ([Blust 1997](Source#cldf:blust1997)), where the former make implicit reference to a three-dimensional bounded space, and the latter to a planar surface. Thus in Austronesian languages one ‘opens’ (unfurls) a flag, one ‘opens’ (removes) one's clothing, or one ‘opens’ (uncovers) an earth oven, and the act of opening primarily makes something come into view or become visible to the observer rather than allowing access into a three-dimensional bounded space for an active agent.  The extension of this term to the use of switches (for electric lights) and the like follows paths of change that are also found outside Austronesian (e.g. in Chinese ).",blust1997

Although many Dutch sources refer to this insect as a ‘wormpje’ (little worm) it is clear from the better descriptions that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_bukbuk_ referred to a weevil that infests wood, bamboo and grains (particularly rice and, following European contact, maize). Oceanic reflexes suggest that the name was transferred to other wood-eating insects, including perhaps the mason wasp and various beetles. Evidently by [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) times the same term was applied to tooth decay, although it is unclear whether this extension was based on simple observation of similarity in the external results, or on a belief in similar underlying causes (glosses in [Isneg](LanguageTable#cldf:647), [Itawis](LanguageTable#cldf:648), [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279), [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423), and [Nggela](LanguageTable#cldf:359)). The unusual phonetic development in [Kiput](LanguageTable#cldf:18958) _busueʔ_, together with other developments in the languages of northern Sarawak, was earlier used to justify a trisyllabic proto-form &ast;_bubuSuk_ ([Blust 1974](Source#cldf:blust1974)); this interpretation has now been abandoned in favor of a suggestion by [Dahl (1976)](Source#cldf:dahl1976) that &ast;_bukbuk_ developed a phonetically complex medial consonant which then became &ast;_f_, and finally _s_.",blust1974;dahl1976

This item is one of several conforming to the canonical shape &ast;CVCVS in which [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) and [MP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) witnesses differ in the order of the last two consonants.  A number of the languages of the southeast and central Moluccas, including [Selaru](LanguageTable#cldf:409), [Yamdena](LanguageTable#cldf:1130), [Asilulu](LanguageTable#cldf:18016), and [Paulohi](LanguageTable#cldf:925) nonetheless reflect earlier &ast;_buka_, a form which appears to reflect [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_bukeS_ without the expected metathesis of the last two consonants (hence [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_bukah_).

[PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_buhek_ contrasted with &ast;_bulu_ ‘body hair; downy feathers; plant floss’.  The English gloss ‘head hair’ is potentially ambiguous, however, since it could be taken to include facial hair.  However, the eyebrows and eyelashes evidently were classified as types of &ast;_bulu_, not &ast;_buhek_, and in at least one language ([Bare'e](LanguageTable#cldf:236)) the fine downy hairs on the forehead which border the hairline are classified as types of &ast;_bulu_ in contrast to the head hair proper.",

[Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) posited &ast;_bukid_ ‘mound of earth’, but the final consonant of his reconstruction cannot explain various reflexes in northeastern Luzon.  The referent of this form probably is not represented by any single English term.  It seems clear that it included ‘mountain’, but there are various indications (particularly the glosses in [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370), [Itawis](LanguageTable#cldf:648), and [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276), but also other reflexes that refer to natural vegetation or to cultivated plants) that the concept ‘mountain’ was inseparably associated with heavily forested terrain, as opposed to the more open terrain of the coast.  A number of the forms in western Indonesia appear to be [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) loans, as indicated both by irregular reflexes of the final consonant and by the distinctively [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) use of _bukit_ to refer exclusively to hills in opposition to mountains.",dempwolff193438

This item probably contains the root &ast;[-ku(q)](cf.csv#cldf:Root-29951)) ‘bend, curve’. While [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_siku_ (with the same root) is the only secure candidate for ‘elbow’, &ast;_buku_ is a poor competitor with &ast;_tuSud_ ‘knee’, a form that is widely reflected in Taiwan, the Philippines, and Indonesia. This fact suggests that &ast;_buku_ ‘knee’ is historically secondary, and may have arisen in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) as a stylistic variant of the ordinary word for ‘knee’. For a parallel development with the same root cf. [Sundanese](LanguageTable#cldf:418) _deku_ ‘knee’, and for a parallel with a different but formally similar root &ast;[-kuŋ](cf.csv#cldf:Root-29948) ‘bend, curve’, cf. [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660) _dekuŋ_ ‘knee’ (lit. ‘bending part’).



The basic sense of &ast;_buku_ appears to have been that of a joint or node, as in cane-like grasses or the human body.  Since the joints of the human body are often associated with swellings or subcutaneous protrusions references to the latter commonly appear as a secondary semantic component of this term, one which apparently has led in some languages to contamination with reflexes of &ast;_buŋkul_ ‘swelling, lump or bump under the skin’.  The somewhat puzzling agreement of [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) _buku-búku_, [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432) _voho_ and the phonologically irregular [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325) form _boko_ in pointing to the meaning ‘back’ may arise from the back having been conceived as the preeminent locus of joint-like articulations (the length of the spinal column). In the sense of a swelling or lump-like object it is clear that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_buku_ also referred to gnarls on trees and to knots in string or rope.  The widespread practice of tying knots in a cord to keep track of the passage of days leading up to some designated event ([Kelabit](LanguageTable#cldf:299), [Penan](LanguageTable#cldf:18658), [Tontemboan](LanguageTable#cldf:19052), [Eddystone/Mandegusu](LanguageTable#cldf:261)) must be assumed to have a [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) antiquity and is, of course, paralleled in other parts of the world (e.g. the Inca _quipu_).  




Finally, as a more abstract extension of the physical notion of articulation, reflexes of &ast;_buku_ refer to discrete units of language or discourse both in [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) ([Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427), [Balinese](LanguageTable#cldf:235)) and in [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) ([Kapingamarangi](LanguageTable#cldf:292)).",

This cognate set encodes an animistic belief that traditionally was widespread among speakers of Philippine languages.  As suggested by variations in the form of the name the distribution of the _bulalákaw_ belief may in part be a product of borrowing, but its genealogy probably extends to [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:19083).  Although most of the known evidence from Mindanao identifies the &ast;_bulalakaw_ with the spirits of lakes and rivers, the older association appears to have been with the spirits of meteors or shooting stars.  The puzzling [Ifugaw](LanguageTable#cldf:636) reference to the whiteness of a wealthy young man and the [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) reference to whiteness of the skin caused by contact with a spirit fireball suggests another feature of the belief which cannot be completely teased out of the available glosses.

The reconstructed meaning is not supported by the above forms, but is suggested by [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573) _pulan_ in conjunction with [Batu Merah](LanguageTable#cldf:525) _mata hulane_ (‘eye of the _hulane_’) and less directly [Niue](LanguageTable#cldf:362) _mahina alili_ ‘eye of cateye shell’ (where _mahina_/ = ‘moon’).",

[Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573) _pulan_ and [Tetun](LanguageTable#cldf:1060) _ikan fulan_ are assumed to be reductions of an originally reduplicated base, a change apparently reflected also in the [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) and [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) variants cited here.  This word may be connected ultimately with [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_bulan_ ‘moon’ through a reduplication process which created nouns from a base X meaning ‘X-like’ or ‘similar in appearance to X’.



The Oceanic portion of this comparison was first noted by [Osmond (2011)](Source#cldf:osmond2011).",osmond2011
25658,*bulaN,b,"moon, month; menstruation","Also [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285) _rembulan_ ‘moon’, [Gorontalo](LanguageTable#cldf:272) _hula_ ‘moon, month’, [Sika](LanguageTable#cldf:414) _bulan_ ‘month’, [Tanga](LanguageTable#cldf:425) _funil_ ‘moon’, [Tolai](LanguageTable#cldf:19416) _bulā_ ‘the moon, esp. in incantations’. 



[PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_bulaN_ is one of the more widely reflected forms in Austronesian languages, particularly in island Southeast Asia.  Its primary sense clearly was ‘moon, lunar month’, but alone, affixed, or in collocation it also referred to the menstrual cycle.  Other notions which are encoded by a reflex of &ast;_bulaN_ and which probably involve universal tendencies in lexical semantics are: 1. the use of ‘months’ to refer in some way to the duration of a pregnancy ([Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423), [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331), [Balinese](LanguageTable#cldf:235) and [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372)), and 2. the association of phases of the moon with mental or emotional instability or otherwise unpredictable behavior.  Many Austronesian languages name the phases of the moon, and/or the months of the year with a reflex of &ast;_bulaN_, but specific morphologically complex forms do not appear to be inferrable from the available evidence.  



Finally, generalized semantic agreements such as that in e.g. [Isneg](LanguageTable#cldf:647) _sinam-búlan_ ‘central part of the bottom of a basket’, [Arosi](LanguageTable#cldf:485) _hura_ ‘circular bottom edge of a bowl’ probably are convergent, but the more specific agreement in [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _bulan baju_ ‘crescentic collar piece’, [Arosi](LanguageTable#cldf:485) _hura_ ‘the round pearl shell disk of a chief, representing the full moon’ is more likely to continue a [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) usage.",
25666,*bulaŋ,b,artificial cockspur; bind on an artificial cockspur,"Also [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) _olaŋ_ ‘raise the hand ready to strike’.  Although this comparison provides prima facie evidence for the presence of cockfighting in [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) society (circa 1500-2000 BC), it must be treated with caution.  First, the use of artificial cockspurs implies the use of metals, most likely iron, for utilitarian purposes at least a millennium earlier than the oldest archaeological evidence for iron artefacts in island Southeast Asia.  Second, although the basic sense of this term in the Philippines and western Borneo is ‘cockfight’ or ‘metal cockspur’, in [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) and some other languages of western Indonesia the basic sense of the term is not ‘metal cockspur’, but rather ‘to bind one object to another by winding around’, with special reference to metal cockspurs.  


Cockfighting is a central male social theme of many of the traditional cultures of Indonesia and the Philippines, but its antiquity in the Austronesian world remains obscure.  The practice has never been reported from any of the aboriginal peoples of Taiwan, and although the cock evidently was a component of the Austronesian settlement of the Pacific, cockfighting was not.  It is likely that the practice of cockfighting originated only after the use of iron for utilitarian purposes became common in the Austronesian world, since the manufacture of metal cockspurs evidently was essential to produce lethal (and hence for betting purposes, decisive) results.  The earliest archaeological evidence for ironworking technology in the Austronesian world dates from western Indonesia after 500 BC ([Bellwood 1997 [1985]:272](bib-Bellwood)); a plausible scenario, then, is that cockfighting was innovated in western Indonesia some 2000-2500 years ago and spread rapidly into the Philippines and eastern Indonesia.  The present linguistic comparison is assumed to reflect a historically secondary semantic elaboration of an etymon which originally had the more general sense ‘to bind one object to another’.  For convenience it is labeled as [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094), but the meaning, and perhaps the form itself evidently date from a later period.",

This highly contentious etymology presents several problems.  First, the forms in [Sangir](LanguageTable#cldf:402), between northern Sulawesi and the Philippines, and in [Manggarai](LanguageTable#cldf:816) and [Rembong](LanguageTable#cldf:391) of western Flores in the Lesser Sundas appear to be borrowed from [Buginese](LanguageTable#cldf:239) or [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325).  Moreover, as a result of the Spanish presence in northern Taiwan (1626-1642) several loanwords from Spanish and from Philippine languages entered [Kavalan](LanguageTable#cldf:293), and it is possible that _berawan_ is one of these.  Second, evidence from both Philippine languages and [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) suggests that &ast;_bulaw-an_ is derived by affixation from a stem that did not mean ‘gold’. Third, [Thao](LanguageTable#cldf:1062) _ma-bulaw_ ‘ripe (of fruits, vegetables, grains), golden, yellow-orange’ is clearly related, but cannot be native, since &ast;_b_ normally > _f_.  It probably is a loanword from [Bunun (Northern)](LanguageTable#cldf:563), although current lexicographic resources for [Bunun](LanguageTable#cldf:250) do not allow us to determine this with certainty, and no attested [Bunun](LanguageTable#cldf:250) dialect preserves &ast;l as a liquid. However, since a reflex of &ast;_bulaw-an_ is also attested in Taiwan ([Kavalan](LanguageTable#cldf:293) _berawan_ ‘gold’), it appears likely that this form was found in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072).




The complete absence of the simple stem in most languages that contain a reflex of &ast;_bulaw-an_ suggests that the latter is a loanword, borrowed in isolation from the morphological paradigm in which it was created.  On the other hand, a number of the forms cited here have undergone regular sound changes, or distinctive semantic changes, and do not appear to be recent loans ([Kelabit](LanguageTable#cldf:299) _belawan_, [Bare'e](LanguageTable#cldf:236) _wuyawa_, [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947) _bulaan_, various forms in the central Moluccas).  Also, it is possible that &ast;_bulawan_ was a trisyllabic stem which was reanalyzed as containing the suffix &ast;_-an_ (but if so it is necessary to hypothesize convergent reanalyses in various Philippine languages and in [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577).  



The matter thus remains in limbo.  In any case, even if the distribution of this term is in part a product of diffusion it is clear that reflexes of &ast;_bulaw-an_ must have been borrowed much earlier than forms of [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _emas_ ‘gold’, which are transparent loans in a number of the languages of Indonesia Appendix A).  Finally, the agreement in semantic structure between Sulawesian forms such as [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245) _tagin bulawan_ and [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947) _punti bulaan_ with [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _pisaŋ emas_ (all lit. ‘golden banana’) may be a calque, but is perhaps more likely the reflex of an older term &ast;_punti bulawan_.",

To judge from the attested semantic reflexes, this visually striking shell probably was used both for ornamentation and for various utilitarian purposes connected with fishing (net sinker, lure for squid or octopus).  The three reflexes from northern Luzon are at least in part due to borrowing from [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279), and they could be treated as distinct from this comparison.  However, to do so would slight the striking formal and semantic agreement between [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) _bulí_ and [Rotinese](LanguageTable#cldf:395) _fuli_.  It is assumed that the semantic change in Philippine languages reflects a transfer of function from the old material used for net sinkers (cowrie shells) to a newer replacement.  The lowered last vowel in all Polynesian forms is not the normal reflex, but a similar change is attested in a number of other lexical items.",

Agreements in various Philippine languages and [Sika](LanguageTable#cldf:414) indicate that &ast;_buliR_ probably referred to an entire stalk of bananas while still on the plant in contradistinction to a hand of bananas that has been broken from the stalk. Cross-cutting agreements in various languages of western and eastern Indonesia suggest that &ast;_buliR_ also designated an ear of grain, particularly the rice-head.  Although these glosses to a large extent are in complementary distribution, the reconstruction of homophones in such a case clearly would be unsatisfactory.  It thus appears most likely that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_buliR_ meant both ‘(entire) stalk of bananas’ and ‘ear/head of grain’.",

This word contrasted with &ast;_buhek_ ‘head hair’ in designating all types of body hair, including facial hair (e.g. eyelashes, eyebrows, moustache), the downy feathers of birds and chickens (as opposed to e.g. the tail feathers), the fur of animals, the fine floss on fruits and the stems of plants, and the hair-like appendages on some roots. 


 In addition, [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_bulu_ also functioned as the general term for ‘color; type, kind’, as evidenced by reflexes in [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432), [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276), [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660), [Sasak](LanguageTable#cldf:404), [Mandar](LanguageTable#cldf:813) and [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325), [Rennellese](LanguageTable#cldf:390), [Nukuoro](LanguageTable#cldf:363) and [Hawaiian](LanguageTable#cldf:620) (cp. the similar usage in the English expression ‘birds of a feather flock together’,). The similar use of a reflex of &ast;_bulu_ to describe a dirty-white or mousy coloration in horses both in [Sasak](LanguageTable#cldf:404) and in [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325) must be a product of contact, just as [Simalur](LanguageTable#cldf:415) _enáe bulu aeam_ ‘fish sp.’, [Sichule](LanguageTable#cldf:1011) _bulu ayam_ ‘fish sp.’ appear to be borrowings of [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _ikan bulu ayam_, _ikan belayam_ ‘small anchovy-like fish, Makasar red fish: _Stolephorus_ sp., _Coilia_ spp., _Engraulia_ spp.’.  Finally, the nasal coda in [Sika](LanguageTable#cldf:414) _wulu-ŋ_ ‘body hair, fur, feathers’ probably is the general grammatical marker _-ŋ_ in [Sika](LanguageTable#cldf:414), rather than a reflex of &ast;_-n_.",

In the absence of a chromatically neutral term for ‘grue’ (green-blue) or ‘yellow’ it would be surprising to find a term that referred specifically to darker hues of blue, as appears to be the case with &ast;_buluŋ_.  Nonetheless, borrowing must be ruled out for the [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) forms, and the precise formal and semantic agreement of the [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285) and Southeast Solomonic terms is difficult to attribute to convergence.",

Agreements between Greater Central Philippine reflexes and the gloss for [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314) _buluŋ-buluŋ_ point clearly to a type of foliage that had medicinal value. Although the class of plant material so categorized may have included various leaves, it appears likely from the glosses in [Banggai](LanguageTable#cldf:238) and [Soboyo](LanguageTable#cldf:419) that the meaning of &ast;_buluŋ_ was determined more by cultural usage than by any purely botanical character.",

The meaning of this term remains somewhat elusive.  Although [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_bunuq_ clearly corresponded to English ‘kill’, reflexes in a number of languages in the Philippines and Sulawesi suggest that the notion encoded was more specifically that of killing by piercing, in particular by piercing with a hurled object such as a spear. Since a similar idea appears to be present in the single gloss available from a [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) language it appears likely that this component of the meaning is old, and perhaps primary ([PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_pa-aCay_ being the neutral or general term meaning ‘kill’).  I assume that the meaning ‘enemy’, attested both in Borneo and the Lesser Sundas, is a product of convergent development (cp. [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_busuR_ ‘enemy’).  Finally, despite their superficial similarity the reciprocal constructions seen in [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) _pem-bonoʔ_ and [Kelabit](LanguageTable#cldf:299) _pe-bunuʔ_ appear to have distinct origins, as the latter must be derived synchronically from a prefix _pep_-.",

The basic meaning of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_buŋa_ was ‘flower, blossom’.  Although this term apparently applied to some flowers which do not precede the formation of fruits (e.g. [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_buŋa na baRu_ ‘hibiscus’), in the great majority of cases it referred to the blossom of a fructifying tree or bush.  


Following western contact the idea of cultivating flowers for their beauty became established, and in many of the languages of western Indonesia [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _buŋa_ was borrowed as a term for flowers artificially grown in gardens, as opposed to the natural blossoms of fruits.  In [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:19083) the [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) terms &ast;_buaq_ ‘fruit; areca nut’ and &ast;_buŋa_ ‘flower, blossom’ underwent a co-ordinated semantic shift in which &ast;_buŋa_ surrendered its referent to an innovated term ([PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:19083) &ast;_budak_), and took on the meaning of &ast;_buaq_, while the latter came (or continued) to apply to a wide range of roundish organic products, including grains, berries, seeds, nuts, and the endosperm of a germinating coconut, but no longer functioned as the generic term for ‘fruit’.  


It is noteworthy that after this semantic shift many of the same extended senses associated with the core meaning of &ast;_buaq_ also became associated with &ast;_buŋa_, including ‘interest on a loan’ ([Ifugaw](LanguageTable#cldf:636), the Batak languages, [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577), [Sundanese](LanguageTable#cldf:418), [Balinese](LanguageTable#cldf:235), [Bimanese](LanguageTable#cldf:241), [Komodo](LanguageTable#cldf:708), [Rembong](LanguageTable#cldf:391), [Kambera](LanguageTable#cldf:678)), ‘kidney’ ([Mansaka](LanguageTable#cldf:825)), ‘mouse’ ([Aklanon](LanguageTable#cldf:226)), and ‘words, speech’ ([Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427)).  The inclusion of [Thao](LanguageTable#cldf:1062) _buna_ ‘sweet potato’, [Puyuma](LanguageTable#cldf:386) _buŋa_ ‘sweet potato: _Ipomoea batatas L._’ could be used to justify a [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) etymon but this form, referring to an introduced plant, almost certainly is a loan from one of the languages of northern Luzon (most likely [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279)).",

The formal and semantic similarity of &ast;_buku_ ‘node, joint, knuckle, knot’, and &ast;_buŋkul_ ‘swelling, lump or bump under the skin’ apparently has given rise to contamination between these forms, particularly in languages that have lost original final consonants (thereby removing the most important phonological basis for distinguishing the two).

According to [Darlington (1957:229)](bib-Darlington) breeding populations of the saltwater crocodile populate the Pacific as far as the Southeast Solomons. However, because _Crocodilus porosus_ can cross sea intervals of up to several hundred miles individual specimens of the animal occasionally are seen much further to the east. [Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) wrote &ast;_b-uh-aya_, but his arbitrary segmentation of this morpheme was based on a misunderstanding of certain aspects of the historical phonology of [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577), [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285), and some other languages in western Indonesia, particularly Borneo, where prepenultimate vowels merged as schwa, and then deleted prevocalically (leaving various forms of _baya_).  


By strict application of subgrouping requirements to semantic reconstruction the meaning of &ast;_buqaya_ would remain somewhat less specific than ‘crocodile’, since the meanings in [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) and [MP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) witnesses differ.  Despite this limitation there are at least three pieces of evidence that &ast;_buqaya_ meant ‘crocodile’ not only in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081), but also in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072): (1) a general term for ‘shark’ (&ast;_qiSu_) is already available, (2) outside Taiwan reflexes of &ast;_buqaya_ invariably carry the primary sense ‘crocodile’, (3) _C. porosus_ was earlier present on the coast of southeastern China, and hence presumably in Taiwan ([Pope 1935:65](Source#cldf:pope1935)), but disappeared before the historical period.  Under these circumstances the application of the name of a dangerous reptilian aquatic predator to its functional equivalent in the world of fishes is not surprising.  Several other inferences connected either denotatively or connotatively with &ast;_buqaya_ which do not involve an actual linguistic reconstruction nonetheless seem warranted. First, the crocodile clearly was associated with ravenous greed and rapacious behavior by at least [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) times.  Second, some type of boys’ game was played which imitated this character ([Casiguran Dumagat](LanguageTable#cldf:569), [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) and [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325)).  Third, the expression ‘land crocodile’ (&ast;_buqaya ni taneq_?) referred to an unprincipled person driven by selfish greed.  Finally, a morphologically complex form of this word evidently meant ‘seahorse’ by at least [PCEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19074) times ([Yamdena](LanguageTable#cldf:1130) and [Lau](LanguageTable#cldf:313)).  Reflexes in [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) and [Tontemboan](LanguageTable#cldf:19052) suggest somewhat vaguely that this usage may have a longer history, or that other types of fish may also have been designated by a reflex of &ast;_buqaya_.",dempwolff193438;pope1935[65]

This word shows clear evidence of borrowing in a number of languages (e.g. [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660), and Modern [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285), [Bare'e](LanguageTable#cldf:236), [Wolio](LanguageTable#cldf:1124), [Bimanese](LanguageTable#cldf:241)  and [Manggarai](LanguageTable#cldf:816), all with _b_ for expected _w_).  The context for borrowing this word probably was the diffusion of cockfighting, after it was acquired as a cultural innovation following the break-up of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081).  Enough forms in the Philippines and western Indonesia appear to be directly inherited to justify a [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) etymon, and with it an inference that cockfighting probably was introduced from outside or developed within the Philippine-Greater Sunda area circa 2,000 B.C.

This term was the subject of a misguided discussion in the earlier literature, in which diphthongs &ast;_-ew_ and &ast;_-ey_ were proposed as addenda to those reconstructed by Dempwolff ([Dyen 1953a](Source#cldf:dyen1953), [Hendon 1964](Source#cldf:hendon1964)).  It now seems clear that &ast;_buRaw_ had two rather well-defined semantic foci: 1) it applied to the act of chasing animals from the cultivated fields, above all to frightening off birds from the rice fields by vigorous shouting (the latter element being preserved as a distinct semantic component in [Ngadha](LanguageTable#cldf:357) _buro_), 2) it applied to humans, in which case the meaning was that of banishment or exile from the village (in the case of individual persons) or that of migration (in the case of the entire resident community). Since its application to animals appears to have been more frequent and fundamental, it probably is no accident that reflexes of &ast;_buRaw_ are confined largely to those societies that traditionally retained the cultivation of grain crops. 



The problems surrounding the change &ast;_-aw_ to _u_ in [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) and some of its closest relatives remain unsolved.  This change (and the comparable change &ast;_-ay_ to _i_) are paralleled in other forms, but are confined to [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) and a few other languages of western Indonesia which are either closely related to [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), or which have numerous [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) loanwords, or both.  There is thus no basis for a triangulation of the proposed &ast;_-aw_, &ast;_-ew_ and &ast;_-ay_, &ast;_-ey_ distinctions to any proto-language higher than the hypothetical immediate common ancestor of [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Acehnese](LanguageTable#cldf:225), the Chamic languages, and perhaps [Sundanese](LanguageTable#cldf:418).  Both the irregular form and the innovative meaning show that the [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) reflex of &ast;_buRaw_ was borrowed into a number of languages in the Sumatra-Java-Bali region, in a few cases resulting in etymological doublets (e.g. [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314), with native _buro_ and borrowed _buru_).",dyen1953;hendon1964

25746,*buRbuR₁,b,"rice porridge, rice gruel","Also [Amis](LanguageTable#cldf:227) _folfol_ ‘break into small pieces, crumble’, [Isneg](LanguageTable#cldf:647) _b-in-ulbúg_ ‘very soft cooked rice’, [Kankanaey](LanguageTable#cldf:289) _búbu_ ‘cooked  rice’, [Binukid](LanguageTable#cldf:19012) _bulbug_ ‘to make (rice or corn) porridge’, [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) _bubur_ ‘rice porridge, rice which is cooked soft and watery’, [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660) _bubur_ ‘porridge; crushed, destroyed, shaken to pieces, in ruins, collapsed’; _a-bubur_ ‘prepare porridge; crush (stone, enemy), cut to pieces, destroy completely, exterminate’, [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285) _bubur_ ‘a ceremonial porridge’; _mubur_ ‘make ingredients into this porridge’, [Buginese](LanguageTable#cldf:239) _bubu_ ‘cooked rice which is not mixed with corn’, [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325) _buʔburuʔ_ ‘rice porridge’, [Asilulu](LanguageTable#cldf:18016) _bubor_ ‘porridge’, [Buruese](LanguageTable#cldf:251) _bubur_ ‘rice porridge’.  


Although this term and its referent can be firmly associated with [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094), borrowing from [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) has somewhat obscured its primary distribution in Indonesia.  Both Batak forms show irregular reductions of the medial consonant which point to borrowing, and for different reasons the words in [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660) and Modern [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285), and [Buruese](LanguageTable#cldf:251) are also suspect. Although the [Sundanese](LanguageTable#cldf:418), [Rembong](LanguageTable#cldf:391) and [Kambera](LanguageTable#cldf:678) forms can be treated as native, it is likely on distributional grounds that they, too, are [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) loanwords.

As suggested by [Mills (1975:2:653)](Source#cldf:mills1975) there can be little doubt that this term functioned within the context of traditional shamanistic herbal medicine, referring to the action of spewing masticated medicinal herbs on the surface of the skin over a painful part of the body. The distribution of semantic reflexes suggests that premasticated betel nut was the preferred medicinal simple; the practice probably was common for stomach ailments and headache. Finally, this item illustrates the process of ‘semantic fragmentation’ ([Blust 1987](Source#cldf:blust1987)) in a striking manner, since e.g. [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947) _bura_ ‘remedy, medicine’ and [Molima](LanguageTable#cldf:18975) _wula_ ‘to blow out water, as a whale’ appear at first to have no common semantic ground, yet emerge as straightforward cognates once it is recognized that each has selected and developed one component of the original meaning to the exclusion of the other.",mills1975[2:653];blust1987

Based on cognates only in [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) and [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285) [Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) posited &ast;_buni_ ‘tree sp.’.  However, he missed the [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) variant _berunay_ (assumed to be a metathesis of earlier &ast;_burenay_), and did not consider the numerous Philippine forms or the rarer western Indonesian forms which attest to a medial cluster.  It is now known that [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) and some other closely related languages in western Indonesia show an unexplained minor sound correspondence in the diphthong of this and a handful of other forms.  [Dyen (1949:421)](Source#cldf:dyen1949) and [Nothofer (1984)](Source#cldf:nothofer1984) have attributed this correspondence to a [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) diphthong &ast;_-ey_, but their inferences cannot be justified by the normal comparative procedure of triangulation for any proto-language more remote than the immediate common ancestor of these discrepant witnesses.  


A factor which considerably complicates the problem of determining the membership of this group is the great influence that [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) has had for many centuries as a source of loanwords throughout island Southeast Asia.  To a lesser extent (both in terms of chronology, and of the geographical range of its influence) the same is true of [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285), which may be the source of both [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _buni_ and [Manggarai](LanguageTable#cldf:816) _wuni_.",dempwolff193438;dyen1949[421];nothofer1984

27155,*buRu₁,b,to blow,,
25761,*buRuk,b,rotten meat; addled eggs; bad character,"Also [Ifugaw](LanguageTable#cldf:636) _bulók_ ‘idea of being rotten, becoming rotten; applied to pieces of wood, thatched roofs, clothing worn out, etc.’, [Kapampangan](LanguageTable#cldf:291) _bugúk_ ‘rotten’; _ma-buguk-buguk_ ‘going crazy’; _bulúk_ ‘rotten, fetid’; _pa-bulúk_ ‘allow to become fetid’, [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _bulók_ ‘rotten, putrid’, [Bikol](LanguageTable#cldf:244) _bulók_ ‘rotten, decayed’, [Aklanon](LanguageTable#cldf:226) _bulók_ ‘no good, worthless, of very poor quality’, [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) _bulúk_ ‘rotten; to rot, decompose’, [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) _kam-borok-an_, _tam-borok-an_ ‘rotten’, [Sa'a](LanguageTable#cldf:18945) _mate-hulu_ ‘the final stage of ripeness of a coconut’.  


A number of Philippine forms that appear to reflect &ast;_buluk_ are assumed to result from a two-step borrowing process: 1. [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _buruk_ was borrowed into [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423), presumably as a result of sustained Malay trading activities in the region of Manila Bay prior to the inception of the Manila Galleon in the sixteenth century ([Wolff 1976](Source#cldf:wolff1976), [Blust 1991](Source#cldf:blust1991)), 2. this form was naturalized as [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _bulók_ and then passed on to other languages, both to the north and to the south, probably within the past half millennium.  Remarkably, [Kapampangan](LanguageTable#cldf:291) shows a double layer of borrowing of the same semantic category from [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423): first _bugúk_, a native [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) form, then _bulúk_, a [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) loan almost certainly acquired through [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423).  


It is possible, but rather uncertain on semantic grounds, that [Kapampangan](LanguageTable#cldf:291) _byuk_ ‘scar’ is the only directly inherited reflex of &ast;_buRuk_. Although this term meant ‘rotten’, the range of substances to which it applied remains somewhat unclear.  [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) _vuk_ agrees with a few Philippine witnesses in indicating a meaning ‘rotten, of meat’.  However, in [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) and some other languages a reflex of &ast;_buRuk_ applies to the rotting of wood, metals and other substances in contrast to the rotting of flesh (_busok_).  Moreover, reflexes of &ast;_buRuk_ in a number of [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) and [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076) languages point specifically to the addling of eggs.

The semantic difference between &ast;_buRuk_ and &ast;_busuk_ remains unclear.  Although [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_buRuk_ evidently referred in particular to the addling of eggs, and reflexes of &ast;_busuk_ are more often associated with malodorous rot, there is considerable overlap in the extension of these terms to various types of decay (as in wood), putrefaction (as of flesh), etc.  The available reflexes suggest that in addition to its literal referents &ast;_busuk_ also was applied to undesirable personal traits or to the maligning of reputations.",
25777,*busuŋ,b,be afflicted with a swollen abdomen as a result of violating customary law.,"The meaning of this term is discussed in [Blust (1981)](Source#cldf:blust1981).  Briefly, it is argued there that [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) &ast;_busuŋ_ referred to the culturally-defined consequences of violating customary law, in particular to offenses against kin-based social hierarchy.  As is apparent from the reflexes cited here, it was believed that the offense would be supernaturally redressed through an affliction of the offender which appears in the form of abdominal swelling.  In Christianized societies such as that of the Cebuano Bisayan the traditional belief has been reinterpreted in terms of a personal God exacting retribution, but the available evidence for animistic societies suggests an antecedent stage in which the punishment was impersonal and automatic.  Reflexes in some languages, as [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), suggest an inversion of cause and effect whereby sufferers of physical ailments which caused abdominal swelling were regarded as in some sense deserving of their condition.",blust1981

[PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_busuR_ appears to have meant only ‘hunting bow’.  While the same meaning persisted in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081), many reflexes of this form both in [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) and in [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076) languages refer to a bow-shaped implement used to card cotton or kapok fibers.  Since _Gossypium_ species are adventitious to Southeast Asia, and presumably were introduced during the early stages of Indian contact in western Indonesia, it is unlikely that the use of &ast;_busuR_ for carding _Gossypium_ fibers has an antiquity of more than two millennia.  It is, however, possible that such an instrument was used earlier for carding the fibers of the indigenous kapok.  Phonologically irregular forms such a [Manggarai](LanguageTable#cldf:816) _wusu_ suggest that the practice of carding kapok fibers with a bow-like instrument may have spread from Indianized regions such as Java or the various Malay states of Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula.  If so, it is surprising that the association of a reflex of &ast;_busuR_ with the carding of kapok fibers is found among the geographically more remote mountain peoples of northern Luzon, whereas reflexes in the more accessible lowland areas often refer to a hunting bow (e.g. in [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) and [Bikol](LanguageTable#cldf:244)).  Everything considered it seems safest to conclude that [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_busuR_ referred exclusively to a hunting bow, but that by [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) or at least [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) times this form had taken on the additional meaning of a bow-like instrument used to card the fiber of the silk-cotton, or kapok tree.",

25870,*Cakaw,C,steal,"Also [Bontok](LanguageTable#cldf:246) _ákew_ ‘steal from a house when the residents are out’, [Kankanaey](LanguageTable#cldf:289) _ákew_ ‘steal’, [Ifugaw](LanguageTable#cldf:636) _áko_, _ákaw_ ‘steal’, [Ifugaw (Batad)](LanguageTable#cldf:18225) _ákaw_ ‘steal, esp. of valuable items; do something surreptitiously’, [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) _panekeo_ ‘steal’, [Melanau (Mukah)](LanguageTable#cldf:349) _tikaw_ ‘theft’, _menikaw_ ‘steal’, _t-en-ikaw_ ‘was stolen by’, [Maori](LanguageTable#cldf:330) _whánako_, _whēnako_ ‘steal; theft; thief; thievish’.  This exceptionally complicated comparison requires extensive comment.  The following numbered points concerning first the shape, then the morphology and finally the meaning of &ast;_Cakaw_ and its derivatives should cover the major issues:  



(1) All [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) reflexes of &ast;_Cakaw_ which distinguish &ast;_C_ from &ast;_t_ point unambiguously to &ast;_C_ in this form.  Outside Taiwan, [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_t-_ (the outcome of the merger of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_C_ and &ast;_t_) is widely reflected as the stem-initial consonant, but there are a number of irregularities, including the unexplained loss of &ast;_t-_ in some of the languages of northern Luzon and the widespread nasal replacement of &ast;_t_ in other languages.  The latter irregularities will be treated below under morphology.  Although both [Samal](LanguageTable#cldf:981) (southern Philippines) on the one hand, and the Batak languages and [Nias](LanguageTable#cldf:361) (northern Sumatra) on the other hand, reflect a form with medial prenasalization, I take the prenasalization of &ast;_k_ in this word to be a product of two independent changes.  



(2) [Milke (1968:149)](Source#cldf:milke1968) proposed a doublet &ast;_nakaw_ next to Dempwolff's &ast;_ta(ŋ)kaw_ ‘steal’.  Although forms compatible with &ast;_nakaw_ occur in forms such as [Kayan](LanguageTable#cldf:294) _nakau_ ‘steal’, [Singhi Land Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:412) _noku_ ‘steal’, and [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314) _naŋko_ ‘steal’, these items are synchronically derived form stems with initial _t_.  The same cannot, however, be said of [Kapampangan](LanguageTable#cldf:291) _náko_, [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _nákaw_ ‘steal’ and of widespread reflexes of &ast;_nakaw_ in the Lesser Sundas and central Moluccas.  A doublet &ast;_nakaw_ thus seems unavoidable, despite the fact that in some languages forms of the same shape are regual morphological derivatives of a reflex of &ast;_takaw_.  



(3) Although [Aklanon](LanguageTable#cldf:226) _panákaw_ ‘theft’, [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) _panakau_ ‘thievish, stealing inveterately’ and [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) _panaŋko_ ‘thief’ are derived synchronically from underlying disyllables with initial _t_, [Itbayaten](LanguageTable#cldf:282) _panakaw_, [Manobo (Kalamansig Cotabato)](LanguageTable#cldf:820) _penakaw_, [Tiruray](LanguageTable#cldf:433) _fenakwa_, [Kadazan Dusun](LanguageTable#cldf:287) _panakau_ and reflexes of [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_panako_ ‘steal’ are independent lexical entries.  We might, therefore, posit a third [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) doublet &ast;_panakaw_ next to &ast;_takaw_ and &ast;_nakaw_, an interpretation which appears to be supported by the reconstructions &ast;_panakaw-an_ and &ast;_panakaw-en_.  However, the evidence for a doublet &ast;_panakaw_ differs from the evidence for a doublet &ast;_nakaw_ in one crucial respect: [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) clearly had a prefix &ast;_paŋ-_ which, among other things, derived agentive nouns, whereas there is little reason to believe that active verbs were derived by simple homorganic nasal substitution (as opposed to prefixation with &ast;_maŋ-_).  The patterning of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) morphology thus suggests that &ast;_panakaw_ is a morphological derivative of &ast;_takaw_. Despite this conclusion two serious problems remain: 1. &ast;_panakaw_ presumably meant ‘thief’, yet of the available reflexes only [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) _panaŋko_ supports this interpretation, most languages reflecting &ast;_panakaw_ as a verb or as a non-agentive noun which itself can be affixed to form a verb, 2. reflexes of &ast;_panakaw_ have become independent lexical items in a number of widely distributed languages, yet this has not happened to other morphological derivatives of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_takaw_.  



(4) The morphology of some reflexes of &ast;_Cakaw_ appears superficially to be cognate, but does not stand up to closer inspection.  Thus, [Tetun](LanguageTable#cldf:1060) _hanaʔo_ ‘rob, steal’ appears at first to reflect &ast;_panakaw_, but on closer examination appears instead to contain the Tetun causative prefex _ha-_ plus a reflex of &ast;_nakaw_.  Similarly, [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) _ma-tsakaw_ ‘be, become stolen’ and [Pazeh](LanguageTable#cldf:375) _ma-sakaw_ ‘steal, rob’ appear at first to be cognate with [Sangir](LanguageTable#cldf:402) _ma-tako_ ‘thievish’, [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245) _mo-takow_ ‘thievish in nature’, but the Sulawesian forms clearly contain a reflex of &ast;_ma-_ ‘stative’, whereas the [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) forms do not.  Likewise, the similarity of [Rotinese](LanguageTable#cldf:395) _manako_ (_ma-nako_) and of [Kapampangan](LanguageTable#cldf:291), [Bare'e](LanguageTable#cldf:236) _menako_ ‘steal’ to the [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) and [Pazeh](LanguageTable#cldf:375) forms, or to [Isneg](LanguageTable#cldf:647) _mag-tákaw_ ‘steal’, appears to be a product of convergent innovations in languages that in any case share a common ancestral morphology.  



(5) Most challenging of all is the task of interrelating the affixed forms of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_Cakaw_ and [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_takaw_.  [Wolff (1973)](Source#cldf:wolff1973) has proposed a convincing system of verbal affixation in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) which distinguishes independent from future-general action dependent subjunctive modes.  The independent mode of verbs includes active, direct passive (DP), local passive (LP) and instrumental passive (IP) voices in both nonpast (_-um-_, _-en_, _-an_, _i-_ respectively), and past tense forms (_-inum-_, _-in-_, _-in-_..._-an_, _i-_..._-an_).  At the [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) level the direct available evidence permits us to reconstruct &ast;_Cakaw_ and &ast;_C-in-akaw_.  The former was the stem for verb forms meaning ‘steal’, but when unaffixed probably meant ‘theft’.  The latter clearly meant ‘what is stolen, stolen goods’.  However, more generally [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_-in-_ had two functions: (1) it was a common nominalizer (as in &ast;_C-in-akaw_); (2) it marked the past tense of all four verbal voices, for the active, LP, and IP in combination with other affixes, but for the DP it occurred with a zero allomorph of the DP suffix &ast;_-en_, thus acquiring a ‘portmanteau’ function. The forms which have been reconstructed above are only a fragment of what must have been a fuller paradigm, pieces of which are preserved either in the available [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) evidence or the available [MP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) evidence, but not in both.  Taking into account the morphological evidence form other cognate sets we can tentatively posit the following [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) paradigm for &ast;_Cakaw_: 


<table align=""center"" border=""1"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""0""><tr><th colspan=""5""> &ast;<span class=""pwd"">Cakaw</span> ‘theft’</th></tr>
<tr><th width=""50""> </th><th width=""50"">active</th><th width=""50"">DP</th><th width=""50"">LP</th><th width=""50"">IP</th></tr>
<tr><td>NonPast</td><th> <span class=""wd"">C-um-akaw</span> </th><th> <span class=""wd"">Cakaw-en</span></th><th> <span class=""wd"">Cakaw-an</span></th><th>?</th></tr>
<tr><td>Past</td><th>?</th><th> <span class=""wd"">C-in-akaw</span> </th><th>?</th><th>?</th></tr>
</table>


The active nonpast form &ast;_C-um-akaw_ is reflected in [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) _ts-m-akaw_ ‘steal; do secretly’ and the irregular [Ifugaw](LanguageTable#cldf:636) _um-áko-áko_ ‘steal frequently, be a thief’.  No reflexes of &ast;_C-inum-akaw_ (Wolff's past active) are known.  The nonpast direct passive &ast;_Cakaw-en_ is recorded only from Philippine languages, but must have been present in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) if &ast;_C-in-akaw_ functioned both as a noun and as the past tense form of the direct passive.  Reflexes of &ast;_Cakaw-an_ are known only in [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) languages, where they do not clearly reflect a local passive meaning.  This meaning is, however, clearly reflected in [Kadazan Dusun](LanguageTable#cldf:287) _panaka-an_ ‘the place where one steals’ and [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245) _ponakaw-an_ ‘place where something was stolen or will be stolen’.  No past tense form of the local passive, nor any form of the instrumental voice or the future-general action dependent subjunctive mode is known for this form.  



(6) The principal changes which the foregoing paradigm underwent in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) were the innovation of &ast;_manakaw_ and &ast;_panakaw_.  Both &ast;_t-um-akaw_ and &ast;_manakaw_ must have coexisted for some time as markers of the nonpast active voice in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081), but the latter appears to have dominated the former.  It is unclear whether [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) &ast;_mananakaw_ derives from a form prefixed with &ast;_manaŋ-_, or from a form prefixed with &ast;_maŋ-_ followed by reduplication of the first stem syllable.  



(7) The focal meaning of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_Cakaw_, [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_takaw_ was ‘steal’.  In addition to this gloss, however, &ast;_Cakaw_, &ast;_takaw_ evidently included the meaning ‘do secretly’, as such a sense is reflected in [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370), [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577), [Rotuman](LanguageTable#cldf:394), and perhaps [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314) and [Motu](LanguageTable#cldf:345) (in both of which the notion of clandestine or illicit sexual relations is also expressed).",milke1968[149];wolff1973

[PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_Cali_ was replaced by [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_tales_. This comparison was first noted by [Li (1994)](Source#cldf:li1994).,li1994
25874,*Caliŋa,C,ear,"Also [Thao](LanguageTable#cldf:1062) _lharina_ ‘ear’, [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) _ka-tsaluŋa_ ‘half-moon-shaped tree-fungus (grows in tiers)’, [Kankanaey](LanguageTable#cldf:289) _íŋa_ ‘ear, shell of the ear; handle, lug’ (also = kind of fungus), [Tiruray](LanguageTable#cldf:433) _keliŋo_ ‘ear’; _keliŋoʔ mal_ ‘a mushroom, _Auricularia auricula-judae_ Linn.’, [Tboli](LanguageTable#cldf:19175) _keliŋu_ ‘ear’, _Dali' liŋa_ ‘ear’, [Melanau (Mukah)](LanguageTable#cldf:349) _liŋa_ ‘ear’, [Penan (Long Labid)](LanguageTable#cldf:19338) _keliŋe-n_ ‘ear’, [Kenyah (Long Dunin)](LanguageTable#cldf:755) _keliŋe_ ‘ear’, [Taboyan](LanguageTable#cldf:1032) _keliŋoʔ_ ‘ear’, [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276) _keliŋa_ ‘ear, e.g. on a jar (poetic for pendiŋ)’, [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573) _talaŋa_ ‘ear’, _hayu_ ‘stick, wood’, _talaŋa hayu_ ‘type of fungus, dark brownish and quite slippery when wet, usually attaches to decayed wood and looks just like the ear of people’.  


This item clearly is identical with [Dempwolff's (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) &ast;_taliŋa_ ‘ear’, but various compounds probably existed in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) which indicated the widespread association of at least some types of mushrooms with ghosts on the one hand, and with thunder or lightning on the other (see, for example, [Lévi-Strauss 1976](Source#cldf:levistrauss1976) or [Blust 2000](Source#cldf:blust2000)). The meaning ‘pectoral fins’ in connection with this term was added to [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) by [Osmond (2011:133)](Source#cldf:osmond2011).",dempwolff193438;levistrauss1976;blust2000;osmond2011[133]
25873,*CaliS,C,"rope, cord, twine, string","Also [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _táliʔ_ ‘twine, anything used for tying’, [Bikol](LanguageTable#cldf:244) _mag-táliʔ_ ‘to thread a needle’, [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) _táliʔ_ ‘tie, bind’, [Simalur](LanguageTable#cldf:415) _taliʔ_ ‘kindred, lineage’, [Sasak](LanguageTable#cldf:404) _taliʔ_ ‘to tie, specifically of binding smaller bundles of rice stalks into larger ones’, [Sa'a](LanguageTable#cldf:18945) _ʔäli_ ‘cord’, [Lonwolwol](LanguageTable#cldf:320) _tali_ ‘rope handle of- (suffix-taking)’.  



It seems clear that the fundamental sense of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_CaliS_ and its reflexes was ‘rope, twine, string’ --- that is, manufactured cordage as opposed to natural tying materials.  Nonetheless, this word often is replaced by a reflex of &ast;_waRej_ ‘vine’ in [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) languages, presumably because in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) society vines had become a major material for ropes (cp. [Nauna](LanguageTable#cldf:355) of the eastern Admiralties, where _way_ < &ast;_waRoj_ can mean either ‘vine’ or ‘rope’, but _tIl_ < [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_tali_ can mean only ‘rope’, never ‘vine’).  The reference to pig nets or a rope to hold up a pig net in [Tontemboan](LanguageTable#cldf:19052) of northern Sulawesi and [Tawala](LanguageTable#cldf:1056) of southeastern Papua may be a result of convergence, but it seems at least as likely that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_talih_ was part of the name for some type of trap for ensnaring wild pigs.  Similarly, the reference to entangling snakes in [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) and [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314) may reflect a metaphorical or high frequency phrasal usage of [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) &ast;_talih_.",
25875,*CaluN,C,fallow land; secondary forest,,
30378,*CaNem,C,grave; to bury,"Also [Isneg](LanguageTable#cldf:647) _mag-tamán_ ‘to inter, to bury’, [Lun Dayeh](LanguageTable#cldf:19418) _tinem-en_ ‘will be buried’. As a concrete noun &ast;_CaNem_ seems to have meant ‘grave’, as shown by reflexes in [Kavalan](LanguageTable#cldf:293), [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279), [Itawis](LanguageTable#cldf:648), [Lun Dayeh](LanguageTable#cldf:19418), [Kelabit](LanguageTable#cldf:299), [Kayan](LanguageTable#cldf:294), [Murik](LanguageTable#cldf:869), and [Balinese](LanguageTable#cldf:235) (morphological derivatives in [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) and [Tuvaluan](LanguageTable#cldf:19417) suggest that the base alone is now primarily a verb or abstract noun in these languages). As a verb both ‘to plant’ and ‘to bury’ are widespread in Malayo-Polynesian languages, and evidently co-occurred in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081). However, it should be noted that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_mula_ also meant ‘to plant’. Although this observation might be taken as evidence to favor the gloss ‘to bury’ for [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_tanem_, the glosses of reflexes suggest that this form referred especially to the planting (and transplanting) of rice, while [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_mula_ referred to the planting of other cultigens.



All Cristobal-Malaitan forms cited here are listed under _ano_ ‘earth’ (< [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_taneq_) in the individual dictionaries, but the thematic consonant _–m_ strongly suggests that they derive from &ast;_tanem_; in a number of other Oceanic languages it is unclear whether bases of the shape _tano_ reflect &ast;_taneq_ ‘earth, soil’, or &ast;_tanem_ ‘to bury, plant’, and it is likely that the two forms became derivationally related in the thinking of many speakers.  [Proto-Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_tanom_ underwent an irregular change to [Proto-Polynesian](LanguageTable#cldf:19084) &ast;_tanu_, with the innovative vowel then passed on to its descendants.  A similar irregular change is seen in [Muna](LanguageTable#cldf:350) _tanu_ ‘bury’, but this agreement is treated as a convergent irregularity rather than evidence for a doublet &ast;_tanum_.",

If so, these are the only known reflexes of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_Capa_ in [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) languages.

This important term provides one of the key pieces of evidence that [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_-aS_ and  &ast;_-eS_ merged as [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_-ah_. Although reflexes of &ast;_CumeS_ are widespread they are not nearly as common as those of &ast;_kuCu_ ‘head louse’, thus suggesting that the latter term had greater psychological salience than the former.  This observation is perhaps related to the fact that delousing as a socially significant grooming activity almost invariably involves the removal of head lice rather than body lice --- a behavioral trait which appears to be shared with other primates (as chimpanzees), and which therefore probably has pre-human origins.  In the absence of other evidence for a prefix &ast;_ka-_ which could be added to animal names I tentatively assume that the initial elements in [Sasak](LanguageTable#cldf:404) _ke-tuma_ and [Tetun](LanguageTable#cldf:1060) _ka-tuma_ are products of historically unrelated morphological processes.",
25936,*CuNuh,C,roast food over a fire,"Also [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) _tino_ ‘what is singed, singed off (hair, feathers); what is roasted on hot coals’; _ma-nino_ ‘to singe off hair or feathers, roast on hot coals’, [Laha](LanguageTable#cldf:19289) _kunu-r_ ‘to bake’, [Lou](LanguageTable#cldf:322) _nunun_ ‘roast over hot coals’.  The basic sense of this term seems to have been ‘to roast (tubers, meat, fish, etc.)’, with reference either to an open fire or to a bed of embers --- in other words, to cook without water or fat by direct exposure to heat.  Reflexes in [Wolio](LanguageTable#cldf:1124) and [Motu](LanguageTable#cldf:345) suggest that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_tunu_ also applied to the firing of clay pots, a concept which is in every sense similar to that of roasting except that the object is inorganic.  In many of the available sources a reflex of &ast;_CuNuh_ is additionally given as the translation equivalent of ‘to set on fire, to kindle, to ignite (as a lamp)’ and ‘to burn (something)’.  


Reflexes in [Kambera](LanguageTable#cldf:678), [Tetun](LanguageTable#cldf:1060) and [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372) suggest that this verb was applied to the burning of calcium carbonate to make quicklime, but it is not entirely clear whether it could be applied to any type of object.  In addition the agreement of [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) and several languages of central and southern Sulawesi in supporting the meaning ‘to sacrifice animals’ suggests that &ast;_CuNuh_ referred to burnt offerings, presumably as a part of funeral ceremonies.  One other recurrent semantic reflex --- that of the firing of a weapon ([Nias](LanguageTable#cldf:361), many [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076) languages) is assumed to be a convergent innovation following the introduction of firearms.  Finally, in parts of the central Solomons the ritualistic practice among young males of raising cicatrices on the skin through burning evidently led to a semantic shift to ‘mark left by burning’, and then just ‘dot, spot, blot’ ([Nggela](LanguageTable#cldf:359)).

The fundamental idea expressed by [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_CuSuR_ and its typical reflexes is that of connecting a series of similar objects by stringing or skewering.  The prototypical object for stringing was beads, which were strung into necklaces, while that for skewering probably was fish, which were skewered for roasting. The loss of the medial consonant of this form through regular sound change produced a canonically anomalous monosyllabic content word in some languages, and it was perhaps in response to this situation that the [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) transitive suffix &ast;_-i_ was reanalyzed as part of the stem.",

This is one of the most distinctive innovations defining the Philippine subgroup, as it is an item of basic vocabulary that appears to have replaced &ast;_Raya_ ‘big, large, great’.  Despite its general regularity there are a surprising number of irregular reflexes of this form, including unexplained gemination of &ast;_k_ in several northern Philippine languages, loss of &ast;_-l_ in [Kankanaey](LanguageTable#cldf:289) and replacement of &ast;_l_ by glottal stop in [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) Reflexes of &ast;_dakelaq_ are confined to members of the Greater Central Philippine group and appear to be derivatives of &ast;_dakel_, although the actual morphological relationship is obscure in most languages.  [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573) _dankolo_ ‘big, large, great, huge’ shows a general similarity to this word, but multiple irregularities show that if it is not a chance resemblance it must be borrowed from a Philippine source.",
30222,*dakep,d,"catch, seize; embrace","Also [Manggarai](LanguageTable#cldf:816) _daké_ ‘embrace’.  This verb is well-supported by reflexes in the Philippines and western Indonesia which are clearly cognate with [Thao](LanguageTable#cldf:1062) _sakup_, but reflexes in CEMP languages are virtually unknown ([Capell 1968](Source#cldf:capell1968) lists [Fijian](LanguageTable#cldf:266) _rako-va_ ‘embrace’ only in the English index, and pace <span class=""bib""><a class=""bib"" href=""acd-bib.htm#Dempwolff"">Dempwolff 1938</a></span> this may be a chance resemblance).  


The fundamental meaning of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_dakep_ appears to have been ‘to seize, catch something that is trying to escape’.  With smaller animals this would involve use of the hands, but with larger animals (as pigs) or people it would involve both arms, thus leading to the extended meaning ‘to embrace’ in several languages (where the object is not trying to escape).  However, semantic agreements between [Thao](LanguageTable#cldf:1062) and [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) forms of this base suggest that an affixed (perhaps reduplicated) may also have referred to the childrens’ game of ‘tag’, and agreements between the Batak languages of northern Sumatra and [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325) of southern Sulawesi indicate that at a later period it may have functioned further as a term of measurement for the girth of trees or other objects that are measured by an ‘embrace’.",capell1968

This is an extremely rich comparison in terms of the many directions that the primary sense has taken in various daughter languages.  The basic meaning of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_dalem_ appears to have been ‘insides, area within, inner part of something’.  From this sense it originally had or developed a secondary sense of ‘inner self, feelings, disposition’, an association that is strikingly exhibited by [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) _dálem_ or [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245) _si-daḷom_ ‘liver’ (the seat of the emotions in traditional Austronesian-speaking societies), and that becomes increasingly more prominent in the glosses of compounds in southern Sulawesi, eastern Indonesia, Melanesia and Micronesia (but not in Polynesia).  


A second meaning of this term that is found throughout the language family is ‘deep’, both in a physical sense (deep water, deep pit), and in the abstract sense of ‘profound, as an idea’.  Through the latter nuance it has developed into the verb ‘to think, to remember’ in languages such as [Motu](LanguageTable#cldf:345). Finally, preceded by the generic locative marker &ast;_i_ the expression _&ast;i dalem_ meant ‘in, inside, within’.

A lexical distinction between termite as a general term and flying termite is maintained in some modern languages, as [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), and [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947) of central Sulawesi, and so evidently continues a similar distinction in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081).

This comparison presents an apparent contradiction, since it is in competition with &ast;_daRaq_ ‘blood’, a form that is widely attested in both Formosan and Malayo-Polynesian languages.  The simplest explanation would appear to be that &ast;_daRaq_ was found in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) in the meaning ‘blood’, and that &ast;_damuq_ is a later innovation spread by borrowing among Formosan languages.  However, with the possible exception of [Puyuma](LanguageTable#cldf:386) _damuk_, which may be an irregularly transmitted loanword from [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370), reflexes of &ast;_damuq_ show a geographical distribution within Taiwan that cannot easily be explained by borrowing.

Although [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_danaw_ apparently meant ‘lake’, the exact meaning of this term would have depended upon the region of Taiwan that was occupied while [Proto-Austronesian](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) remained a single language, since lakes are found in some parts of the island but not in others.  The wide but rather scattered distribution of reflexes elsewhere can probably be attributed to the absence of lakes or significant large bodies of fresh water in many of the environments in which Austronesian speakers settled after leaving Taiwan.  In some areas a reflex of &ast;_danaw_ came to apply to lagoons (salt water), ponds (permanent but small collections of fresh water), or just puddles (temporary collections of fresh water after rain).  


In parts of interior Borneo, where rivers are of major importance but lakes are virtually nonexistent, reflexes of this term were retained but shifted in meaning to refer to muddy areas where rainwater tended to collect but not cover the ground for long; this tendency was carried furthest in [Murik](LanguageTable#cldf:869) where from ‘muddy area, mudpatch’ the meaning developed to ‘muddy’ (still attested in the closely-related [Kayan](LanguageTable#cldf:294)), and then to ‘dirty’.  In other areas where lakes occur, but are rare a reflex of &ast;_danaw_ came to refer to a particular lake, and so was preserved only in proper names, as in [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245) and [Manggarai](LanguageTable#cldf:816).  


The most puzzling distribution is seen in the Oceanic group, where no reflex has been identified so far except in the Central Pacific languages ([Rotuman](LanguageTable#cldf:394), [Fijian](LanguageTable#cldf:266), Polynesian), which implies that prior to reaching western  Polynesia Austronesian speakers were either in continuous contact with bodies of fresh water that were designated by a reflex of [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_rano_, or that they moved through areas that lacked lakes so rapidly that the term was retained in the absence of a referent until arriving in a new environment in which lakes were again encountered.

Nonetheless, throughout the AN language family outside of Taiwan &ast;_danum_ and &ast;_wahiR_ are in competition for the meaning ‘fresh water’.  [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_wahiR_ appears to have meant ‘stream, river’ (and the fresh water in it), while &ast;_danum_ referred only to the water itself.  




Reflexes of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_danum_ have a peculiar distribution: they are common in Taiwan and the northern Philippines, but were replaced by other terms throughout the central and southern Philippines, and throughout all of Indonesia apart from the Barito Basin in southeast Borneo.  In the Pacific they have a rather scattered distribution, being absent from Vanuatu except for two very small areas in west Santo and the Shepherd Islands.  Finally, although most languages reflect only one or the other of these two terms both are found in the Admiralty Islands, where one is the common word for ‘fresh water’ in one language, and the other the semantic equivalent in a closely related language.  In Fiji and Polynesia both occur in the same languages, but with different meanings (PPn &ast;_wai_ ‘fresh water’ : _(&ast;faka-)ranu_ ‘rinse with fresh water after bathing in the sea’), and in [Wayan](LanguageTable#cldf:19060) of western Fiji they co-occur in a single expression (_wai dranu_ ‘fresh water’, as opp. _wai tasi_ ‘salt water’).",dempwolff193438

The regular reflexes of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_R_ in all languages cited here, and the fact that [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573) has a cognate form shows that this statement is false.

[Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) reconstructed this term with the meaning ‘surface; level, plain’ (German:  _Fläche_), but this seems clearly to be in error, as reflexes in [Melanau (Mukah)](LanguageTable#cldf:349) of coastal Sarawak, [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245) of northern Sulawesi, [Tetun](LanguageTable#cldf:1060) of central Timor and [Roviana](LanguageTable#cldf:396) of the western Solomons agree in pointing to the meaning ‘littoral sea’, or perhaps ‘line where the land meets the sea’.  In most Philippine languages reflexes of &ast;_daRat_ refer to the sea without qualification, and in [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) and some other languages of western Indonesia (as [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427)), which may have borrowed their term from  [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), the meaning is ‘land, as opposed to sea’.  While these terms are semantically antithetical, the meaning ‘littoral sea’ serves to bridge them and suggests how the unqualified senses ‘sea’ and ‘land’ may have developed from a meaning that bridged the two.

The semantic distinction between this term and [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_teka_ ‘to come, arrive; reach as far as; reach a destination; to complete’ is unclear, as both words evidently referred to physical arrival, with extended senses that applied to emotions or physical states caused by the ‘arrival’ of epidemic disease or some adverse peersonal condition (epilepsy, fever, menstruation).",

The basic sense of this word in both [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) and [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) was clearly ‘to hear’ both in the sense of receiving an auditory impression and in the sense of receiving information, or news (hence: ‘to hear about’).  As in many traditional cultures where knowledge was transmitted orally, the sense of ‘to hear’ or ‘to listen’ also incorporates connotations of ‘to understand’.  Other meanings that derive from the primary notion of hearing are ‘to obey, heed’, and ‘fame, reputation; famous’ (= ‘heard about, bruited about’).  The most puzzling semantic feature of this base is its extension in a number of Oceanic languages to any sense other than that of sight.  Although this is rarely mentioned in glosses of reflexes outside the Oceanic subgroup, there are indications of a similar notion in [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432) _reni_ ‘heard; perceived, as a scent’, and [Sika](LanguageTable#cldf:414) _rena_ ‘to feel, have a feeling, as in feeling feverish; feeling, sentiment’.

However, both of these languages are members of the Barito subgroup of southeast Borneo ([Hudson 1967](Source#cldf:hudson1967)), and neither supports &ast;_dilap_.",dempwolff193438;hudson1967

This cognate set shows a rather clear semantic innovation in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081), since only the verb ‘to lick’ can be posited for [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072); note that [Favorlang/Babuza](LanguageTable#cldf:19018) and [Siraya](LanguageTable#cldf:416) reflexes of this base meaning ‘tongue’ are formed by _Ca-_ reduplication, a process that is known to occur with some other body-parts ([Blust 1998:38](Source#cldf:blust1998)).  Just as _Ca-_reduplications of &ast;_dilaq_ can mean ‘tongue’ in Formosan languages, affixed forms of &ast;_dilaq_ can mean ‘to lick’ in Malayo-Polynesian languages, but this appears never to be the case for the bare stem.  


Two other semantic developments are noteworthy.  First, once this base had come to mean ‘tongue’ it was then incorporated into expressions meaning ‘to gossip’, ‘to be talkative’, and the like.  Second, in several of the languages of western Indonesia reflexes of &ast;_dilaq_ came to refer to tongues of flame, perhaps beginning in [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) and then spreading through literary use.  This notion then evolved further into much more opaque semantic relationships, as with [Sasak](LanguageTable#cldf:404) _dilaʔ_ ‘to light up, illuminate’.  Finally, reflexes of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_dilaq_ evidently also figured in the names of certain plants, although the details of these collocations are not recoverable from currently available data.  Part of the Formosan evidence for this cognate set was first proposed by [Tsuchida (1976:154)](Source#cldf:tsuchida1976).",blust1998[38];tsuchida1976[154]

Reflexes of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_duSa_ ‘two’ are most focally used as a numeral, but also figure in other types of expressions, such as ‘hesitant, doubtful’ (of ‘two minds’), ‘soul of a living person’ (‘second self’), and ‘second wife’.  [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_duha duha_ can be reconstructed in the sense of ‘two by two’, where is it iconic (since two referents are included each time a transfer takes place), and also in the sense of ‘doubtful, hesitant’, where the iconicity is blurred, since the notion of ambivalence is already present in the word for ‘two’, and yet is repeated (perhaps to indicate duration or persistence).  



Although [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:19083) &ast;_ka-du-duhá_ ‘soul, spirit of a living person’ can be posited based on reflexes in [Isneg](LanguageTable#cldf:647), [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) and [Mansaka](LanguageTable#cldf:825), other languages reaching from Taiwan to Lombok ([Kavalan](LanguageTable#cldf:293), [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279), [Agta (Dupaningan)](LanguageTable#cldf:19194), [Casiguran Dumagat](LanguageTable#cldf:569), [Ibaloy](LanguageTable#cldf:19182), [Pangasinan](LanguageTable#cldf:920), [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577), [Sasak](LanguageTable#cldf:404)) have morphologically distinct forms meaning ‘soul’ that also incorporate a reflex of &ast;_duSa_, and so imply that the notion of the soul of a living person as a ‘second self’ has had a longer history in the Austronesian world. [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) _ka-ra-ruá_ ‘soul; spirit’ suggests that this word may originally have been formed with _Ca-_ reduplication (&ast;_ka-da-duhá_; used only with human referents), and was altered through assimilation in both [Isneg](LanguageTable#cldf:647) and [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) independently.   



In addition, reflexes of &ast;_duSa_ figure in words meaning ‘day before yesterday’ and ‘day after tomorrow’ in many languages, but a lack of agreement in details makes reconstruction impossible.  Finally, some of the subentries posited here, particularly those marked (gloss uncertain), may be products of convergent innovation.",

Hammocks were invented in the tropical rainforests of South America, and so far as is known, nowhere else.  [Bennett (1963:24)](Source#cldf:bennett1963) notes that they “have a wide distribution in Amazonia, the Guianas, Venezuela, and the West Indies, and are also found among the Goajiro of Venezuela, the Cuna and Chocó of tropical Colombia, and the Cueva of Colombia.... Hammocks ae not found in east Brazil, with the exception of the Cre’pumkateye, who are known to have borrowed them.  They are likewise rare in the Chaco, although used as baby cradles by some groups.”  Since hammocks are absent elsewhere in the Austronesian world it seems most reasonable to infer that this word originally referred to a swinging cradle for an infant, and was then extended to include the hammock, which presumably was introduced during the Spanish colonization of the Philippines.

Although European folk traditions tend to see the dugong as a type of aquatic cow (probably because it grazes the sea grass on the ocean floor), Austronesian speakers tend to see it instead as a type of marine pig, probably based on its facial features.  In addition to the [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) variant _babi duyoŋ_ (‘pig dugong’) a comparison of dugongs and pigs is seen in [Kavalan](LanguageTable#cldf:293) _babuy na raziŋ_ (‘pig of the sea’) ‘dugong’ (glossed erroneously as ‘dolphin’ in [Li and Tsuchida 2006)](Source#cldf:liandtsuchida2006), and in [Wogeo](LanguageTable#cldf:19063) _ika boro_ (‘pig fish’) ‘dugong’.  The [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) shape of this form remains unclear.  [Osmond and Pawley (2011:247)](Source#cldf:osmond2011) posit [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_ruyuŋ_, and suggest that [Marovo](LanguageTable#cldf:832) (central Solomons) _rumu_ preserves the final nasal with an unexplained change from velar to labial place of articulation.  However, this is clearly questionable, and there is no other known support for preservation of the last –VC.  The great majority of reflexes in Oceanic languages point instead to &ast;_rui_, but this would be an irregular development from [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_duyuŋ_, leaving the entire matter in limbo.",liandtsuchida2006;osmond2011[247]

In addition to the indisputably cognate forms cited above it is tempting to compare [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372) _e_ ‘prefix used to form number words that refer to units of time’.  However, cognates are unknown in any other non-[OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) language, and [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) mid vowels &ast;_e_ and &ast;_o_ are rare and problematic.  For these reasons I treat [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372) _e_ as a chance resemblance.  



In the standard grammars of [Fijian](LanguageTable#cldf:266) and several of the Polynesian languages the numeral marker _e_ is equated with the predicative or existential marker of similar shape which is widespread in [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) languages.

One hypothesis worthy of further investigation is that a numeral marker &ast;_i_ was innovated in [PCEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19074) and a predicative or existential marker &ast;_e_ was innovated in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082), with a subsequent tendency for the former (which was syntactically more restricted) to be equated with the latter (which was syntactically freer).

The meaning of this form is problematic.  If we simply conjoin the attested glosses it would seem to follow that &ast;_ema_ meant both ‘mother’ and ‘father’.  Such a result, however, would be anomalous, since (1) the meanings ‘mother’ and ‘father’ are represented by [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_ina_ and &ast;_ama_ respectively, and (2) reflexes of &ast;_ina_ apparently never mean ‘father’ and reflexes of &ast;_ama_ apparently never mean ‘mother’.  If we posit &ast;_ina_ and &ast;_ama_ as referential terms, and &ast;_ema_ as vocative, we can eliminate the problem of synonymy raised in (1), since then &ast;_ina_ = ‘mother (ref.)’, &ast;_ema_ = ‘mother (voc.)’, &ast;_ama_ = ‘father (ref.)’, and &ast;_ema_ = ‘father (voc.)’. Nonetheless, we would still have no explanation for the unique occurrence of a single vocative form representing two address forms.  Similarly, we cannot support an inference that the material cited here reflects &ast;_ama_ with oxytone stress, since the divergent semantic evolution of cognates assigned to &ast;_amá_ would remain problematic in any case.  



Alternatively, we might assume that &ast;_ema_ was used in teknonyms, as reported for [Tboli](LanguageTable#cldf:19175) and [Manggarai](LanguageTable#cldf:816).  Even so, the problem of a single teknonym meaning both ‘mother’ and ‘father’ would remain unsolved. The only parallel to the semantic range of &ast;_ema_ known to me is that of &ast;_aya_ ‘FZ’, which is reflected in some languages with the meaning ‘mother’ and in others with the meaning ‘father’, but which also appears in a few languages with the meaning ‘aunt’, or specifically, ‘FZ’.  Perhaps &ast;_ema_ was a vocative/address form of &ast;_aya_, just as &ast;_mama_ was a vocative/address form of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_(ma)tuqah_ ‘MB’.  If so, however, the absence of any reflex which refers exclusively to female collaterals of the parental generation is puzzling, as is the use of the apparently redundant vocative marker _-ʔ_ (for further discussion of vocative marking in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) cf.

26098,*empu,e,"grandparent/grandchild (recipr.); ancestor; lord, master, owner","Also [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _poʔ_ ‘honorific, Sir, Madam’.  This comparison is complex in a number of respects.  First, although it is the most common, it is only one of four stem variants: &ast;_ampu_, &ast;_empu_, &ast;_impu_, and &ast;_umpu_.  Second, an unusual number of affixed forms can be reconstructed next to the simple base. Some of these, as &ast;_empu-ŋ_, &ast;_empu-q_, and &ast;_t-empu_ evidently involved distinctions of vocative/address and referential forms ([Blust 1979](Source#cldf:blust1979)).  Another, &ast;_empu-ni-a_, involves what appears initially to be a possessed kinship term (cp. &ast;_ama-ni-a_ ‘his/her father’) which on closer inspection turns out to function very differently from other kinship terms followed by the genitive marker &ast;_ni_ and the 3sg. object pronoun &ast;_-a_.  The common reflex of &ast;_-i_ ‘local transitive’ in [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _mem-pu-ña-i_ and [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325) _punnà-i_ ‘have, possess’, suggests an etymon &ast;_empu-ni-a-i_.  However, since &ast;_empu-ni-a_ evidently meant ‘its owner’ (lit. ""owner-of-it""), the [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) and [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325) constructions in -/_i_/ must have arisen after the reanalysis of &ast;_empu-ni-a_ as a verb &ast;_empuña_, and hence is a product of independent parallel changes. Likewise, the morphological similarity of [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _per-empu-an_ ‘woman; feminine; womanly (courtly, and in titles)’ and [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245) _pog-ompu-on_ ‘children and grandchildren’ appears to have ho historical basis (cp. [Malay (Jakarta)](LanguageTable#cldf:18430) _perempuan_ ‘woman’, with last-syllable vowel indicating &ast;_-an_, not &ast;_-en_).  



Perhaps most problematic are the forms assigned to &ast;_maki-empu_ and &ast;_paki-empu_.  With regard to the first of these [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245) clearly reflects a prefix &ast;_maki-_ which remains a functional (non-fossilized) affix in such languages as [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) (/_maki_/- ‘prefix used to indicate that something is done with others, etc.’), [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) (/maki/- ask for or make a request for; join in company; imitate’) and [Murut (Timugon)](LanguageTable#cldf:1067) (/_maki_/- ‘petitive’; also /_amaʔ_/ ‘father’:/_maki-amaʔ_/ ‘subject calls object ""father"" ‘, cited in [Prentice 1971:135](Source#cldf:prentice1971)).  Since the [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245) form is supported by the parallel but unglossed [Itbayaten](LanguageTable#cldf:282) form _machi-apo_, cited under _apo_ ‘GP/GC’ (reflecting the variant &ast;_ampu_), the total comparison appears to be explained most simply by assuming loss of the last prefixal vowel independently in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_mokompu_ ‘grandchild’ (with regressive assimilation of the remaining first syllable vowel), and in such [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) forms as [Bare'e](LanguageTable#cldf:236) _makumpu opu_ ‘GGC’ and [Dampelas](LanguageTable#cldf:18954) _maʔupu_ ‘GC’.  Foreshortened forms such as [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314) _k-empu_ ‘GC’, [Rejang](LanguageTable#cldf:389) _k-epew_ ‘GC’ and [Uma](LanguageTable#cldf:19170) _k-umpu_ ‘GC’ can be assigned arbitrarily to forms that begin either with &ast;_maki-_ or with &ast;_paki-_. Semantically, &ast;_empu_ and its variants also present a complex picture.  



Among relatively uncontroversial [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) meanings for all four variants are: (1) GP/GC (recipr.), (2) ancestor, and (3) lord, master, owner.  Meaning (1) places &ast;_empu_ among the set of kinship terms, but it is the only reciprocal term that can be reconstructed for [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081).  Meaning (2) appears to underlie references to totemism in [Manggarai](LanguageTable#cldf:816) _empo_, [Numfor](LanguageTable#cldf:364) _k-epu_, and perhaps in some other languages (see below), while meaning (3) probably underlies at least two seemingly unrelated semantic developments: the meaning ‘parent-in-law’ and the meaning ‘crocodile’.  Reflexes of &ast;_empu_ or one of its variants mean ‘parent-in-law’ in such widely separated languages as [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) (_(h)empo_), [Sangir](LanguageTable#cldf:402) (_empo_), [Kédang](LanguageTable#cldf:695) (_epu_), [Tolai](LanguageTable#cldf:19416) (_tabu-na_), and [Kilivila](LanguageTable#cldf:19026) (_tabu_).  Among the [Kédang](LanguageTable#cldf:695), who practice matrilateral cross-cousin marriage, the term also refers to the mother's brother, and among the [Kilivila](LanguageTable#cldf:19026), who practice patrilateral cross-cousin marriage, it refers to the father's sister.  



I have found no generally accepted explanation for the grouping of terms for grandparents and parents-in-law under reflexes of the same etymon in Austronesian languages, but the alignment follows naturally from a hypothesis that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) speakers practiced matrilateral cross-cousin marriage, since under such an arrangement the wife-giving group is universally regarded as ‘lord, master, owner’ of the wife-taking group ([Blust 1993](Source#cldf:blust1993), and references therein). The term &ast;_empu_ (and its variants) in meaning (3), then, could have acquired its affinal sense through its use as a title reflecting the higher status of the descent group represented by the MB/WF as against that of the ZS/DH.  The recurrent association of grandparents or ancestors with crocodiles and/or other large, dangerous animals is seen in e.g. [Tiruray](LanguageTable#cldf:433) _bébéʔ_ ‘GP/GC; kind of large, black, extremely poisonous snake, considered by the Tiruray to be the original kind of snake, and to have been born of human parents as a twin to a Tiruray child’, [Manggarai](LanguageTable#cldf:816) _empo_ ‘nickname for the crocodile’ (in West Manggarai = ‘crocodile’), [Rembong](LanguageTable#cldf:391) _empoʔ_ ‘GP/GC; crocodile’, Kedayan _bapa_ ‘term of address for the category _epu_; crocodile’ ([Barnes 1974:246-47](Source#cldf:barnes1974)), and in general anthropological references to the Berawan ([Metcalf 1982:254, 257](Source#cldf:metcalf1982)), Malagasy ([Frazer 1960:601ff](Source#cldf:frazer1960)), Mentawai  ([Loeb 1972 [1935]:166](bib-Loeb)), Atoni ([Schulte Nordholt 1971:323](Source#cldf:schultenordholt1971)), where the crocodile is regarded as the ancestor of the ruler of Kupang), and various societies of the southeastern Solomons ([Codrington 1891:178ff](bib-Codrington)).  Such widespread associations may be products of convergent development, but are more likely to reflect totemic ideas that were present in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081)  social organization, together with a mixture of fear and respect for the crocodile as the ‘lord, master, owner’ of the all-important rivers around which Austronesian speakers so often settled. Finally, the semantic connection of [Sasak](LanguageTable#cldf:404) _peŋ-empo-n_ with [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660) _paŋ-empw-an_ is clarified by the discussion of the ‘rice mother’ in [Frazer (1960:479-87)](Source#cldf:frazer1960).","blust1979;prentice1971[135];blust1993;barnes1974[246-47];metcalf1982[254, 257];frazer1960[601ff];schultenordholt1971[323];frazer1960[479-87]"

26111,*-en,e,verbal suffix marking patient or undergoer voice; nominal suffix marking product of an action or thing affected by an action,"&ast;_-en_ is one of the most important affixes that can be reconstructed for [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072), [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) and [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094).  Like other affixes in the ‘focus system’ it evidently marked voice in verbal constructions, and at the same time served to create deverbal nominals.  Both functions are widely attested, the latter often fossilized in reflexes of &ast;_kaen-en_ ‘be eaten/what is eaten = cooked rice’. The use of &ast;_-en_ to mark passive imperatives has not been noted in [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) languages to date, but is widespread in the Philippines and western Indonesia. In some languages, as [Bikol](LanguageTable#cldf:244), there is a synchronic contrast between imperative marking with a reflex of &ast;_-en_, and an alternative marking with a reflex of &ast;_-a_.  The former alternative occurs when a short (agent/possessor) pronoun immediately follows the suffixed verb, while the latter occurs without the pronoun.  In other languages (as [Kelabit](LanguageTable#cldf:299)) imperatives which use a reflex of &ast;_-en_ are felt to be ‘softer’ or more polite than imperatives which do not make use of passive verb  morphology (in this connection cp. also [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) passive imperatives/dehortatives in _di-_, as with _Jaŋan di-gaŋgu guru-mu!_ ‘Don't disturb your teacher!’).  



Since at least two forms of imperative marking can be reconstructed for [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094), it would be worth trying to determine whether a similar contrast existed in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072).  Possibly related (because it is irrealis) is the use of a reflex of &ast;_-en_ to mark future or intended action in [Atayal](LanguageTable#cldf:493) and several Philippine languages, including Hiligaynon Bisayan and [Aklanon](LanguageTable#cldf:226). 



In addition to the above uses, several languages in the Philippines and western Indonesia use a reflex of &ast;_-en_ to mark various types of usually visible bodily afflictions (skin diseases and the like), as well as comparable conditions of decay or deterioration in non-human subjects (e.g. &ast;_bubuk-en_ ‘crumbling, of something infested with weevils’).  Finally, reflexes of &ast;_-en_ are used in some kin terms to mark collaterality, as with &ast;_anak_ ‘child, offspring’, but &ast;_anak-en_ ‘niece, nephew’, &ast;_ama_ ‘father’ but &ast;_ama-en_ ‘uncle’, &ast;_ina_ ‘mother’, but &ast;_ina-en_ ‘aunt’, etc.",

Most affixes that &ast;_esa_ probably took are attested under &ast;_isa_ (q.v.).  The principal issue associated with &ast;_esa_ is perhaps whether the clitic form &ast;_sa-_ already existed in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081), or whether it developed independently in a number of the modern languages.  There appears to be good comparative evidence for reconstructing &ast;_sa-ŋa-puluq_ ‘ten’, and &ast;_sa-ŋa-Ratus_ ‘one hundred’, with clitic &ast;_sa-_ rather than the full form &ast;_esa-_.

This comparison illustrates the inherent voicing instability in velar stops, especially the voiced velar stop ([Blust 1996a](Source#cldf:blust1996)).  The weight of the evidence favors &ast;_g-_ in both [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) and [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081), but — as noted by [Mills (1975:728)](Source#cldf:mills1975) — this was replaced by _k-_ in a number of daughter languages.  Although the primary sense of this term, and the only sense that can be attributed to [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) on present evidence, is ‘itch, feel itchy’, it is clear from a number of reflexes in the Philippines and Indonesia that the word also functioned as a double-entendre for sexual lust.  Moreover, the reflexes in [Aklanon](LanguageTable#cldf:226), [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276), [Gayō](LanguageTable#cldf:610), [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314) and perhaps [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325) suggest that &ast;_gatel_ in the sense of ‘sexually itchy, oversexed’ applied particularly to women, and hence referred to nymphomania in addition to itchiness of the skin.",blust1996;mills1975[728]

For this reason caution must be observed so as not to confuse genuine cognates with products of chance convergence.  It is unclear whether the meaning ‘comb’ in Formosan reflexes of &ast;_garuC_ is original or secondary.

The Malayo-Polynesian evidence unambiguously supports &ast;_k-_ in this form, which initially appears to agree with most Formosan reflexes.  However, Laurent Sagart has 
correctly pointed out that all Formosan reflexes with _k-_ are in fact ambiguous for &ast;_k-_ or &ast;_g_, and that both [Puyuma](LanguageTable#cldf:386) _garaŋ_ (which I had earlier overlooked), and [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) _gaŋ_ point to &ast;_gaRaŋ_, leaving the initial consonant of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_kaRaŋ_ as an unexplained irregularity.

Considering that the octopus is virtually universal in the AN-speaking world in areas near the sea, it is surprising that [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372) _bokitáŋ_ seems clearly to be a loan from [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) or a closely related language.   The final glottal stop in a number of forms is unexplained, but may be indicative of borrowing.  Finally, the unexpected appearance of _g-_ in [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) and [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) is assumed to be a convergent development driven by the inherent instability of the voicing contrast for velar stops ([Blust 1996a](Source#cldf:blust1996)).

Although widely distributed, this form is common only in the _Philippines_ and western Indonesia.  It appears to be entirely absent from Sumatra in the meaning ‘gills’, and is rare in Sulawesi and eastern Indonesia.  In the Pacific it has been attested to date only in western _Melanesia_ and in a single Polynesian language, [Rennellese](LanguageTable#cldf:390) (although [Tuvaluan](LanguageTable#cldf:19417) _kalauaha_ ‘gills’ may contain a reflex).  In several widely separated languages &ast;_hasaŋ_ has been replaced by a reflex of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_Caliŋa_ ‘ear’.  Some of the languages of the [Proto-Admiralty](LanguageTable#cldf:19070), and [Mussau](LanguageTable#cldf:352) of the St. Matthias Archipelago terminologically distinguish the external gills (gill slits) from the internal gills (red fleshy material), and it is possible that such a distinction was innovated in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082).",

With root &ast;[-sek₂](cf.csv#cldf:Root-30084) ‘insert, stick into a soft surface’.  


This word is of some value for inferences about food-production in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) society.  Dibbling is a form of planting used only for seed crops, and only for dry, as opposed to wet rice. [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_hasek_ thus forms one piece of evidence for slash-and-burn dry rice agriculture among Austronesian speakers, circa 3,000 B.C.  In the Pacific, where grain crops were lost, this term has only a few questionable, and if valid, semantically altered reflexes (e.g. [Sa'a](LanguageTable#cldf:18945), [Arosi](LanguageTable#cldf:485) _ato_, _ato-ato_).  [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_pasok_ ‘to plant (in general)’ does not appear to be an affixed form of &ast;_hasek_, but probably contains the same root &ast;[-sek₂](cf.csv#cldf:Root-30084) ‘insert, stick into a soft surface’.",

The gloss of [Casiguran Dumagat](LanguageTable#cldf:569) _asek_, and [Tiruray](LanguageTable#cldf:433) _asek_ (a loan word, probably from a Danaw source) could be taken as evidence that &ast;_hasek_₁ and &ast;_hasek_₂ are a single morpheme.

However, specific applications of this idea to the atmosphere are sufficiently widespread to justify an inference that the etymon meant ‘atmosphere’ (space between earth and sky), or at least included this meaning among its referents. This inference probably is strengthened by the similar semantic range of reflexes of &ast;_awaŋ_.  Apparent reflexes of &ast;_hawan_ meaning ‘cloud’ may be chance resemblances, but are included as possible cognates through their connection with the atmosphere.

The morpheme boundary in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_ma-emis_ had evidently disappeared in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) (&ast;_mamis_), but given the unaffixed reflexes in some [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076) and [South Halmahera-West New Guinea](LanguageTable#cldf:20002) languages we must conclude that this was not the case in [PCEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19074), nor even in Proto-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian.

Two semantic features of this kinship term appear to be beyond dispute: 1. it referred to affines, 2. these affines were of Ego's generation.  However, the glosses in the more detailed dictionaries and in studies devoted specifically to kinship (as [Elkins and Hendrickson 1984](bib-Elkins)) show clearly that in most attested languages reflexes of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_hipaR_ are restricted to a specific subset of same generation affines.  The challenge to semantic reconstruction with &ast;_hipaR_, then, is to define this subset of kin on the basis of well-supported arguments.  


Where the reflex of &ast;_hipaR_ is not simply glossed ‘BIL, ZIL’, it typically refers to a subset of same generation affines defined by relative sex.  There are three fairly well-attested patterns: (1) in a number of the languages of Mindanao in the southern Philippines, and in [Isneg](LanguageTable#cldf:647) of northern Luzon, reflexes of &ast;_hipaR_ mean ‘sibling-in-law of the opposite sex’, that is: BW > (m.s.), ZH (w.s.), WZ and HB; (2) in a number of the languages of Mindanao and in [Gaddang](LanguageTable#cldf:268) of the northern Philippines reflexes of &ast;_hipaR_ mean ‘sibling-in-law’ of the opposite sex (any speaker) and sibling-in-law of the same sex (w.s.)’, that is: BW (m.s.), BW (w.s.), ZH (w.s.), WZ, HB, and HZ; (3) in western [Subanen/Subanun](LanguageTable#cldf:421) of the southern Philippines and in a number of [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) languages including [Lakalai](LanguageTable#cldf:877), [Eddystone/Mandegusu](LanguageTable#cldf:261), [Varisi](LanguageTable#cldf:1101), and [Arosi](LanguageTable#cldf:485), simple reflexes of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081)  &ast;_hipaR_ mean ‘sibling-in-law of the same sex’, that is: BW (w.s.), ZH (w.s.), WB, and HZ; in [Gedaged](LanguageTable#cldf:269) and [Tanga](LanguageTable#cldf:425) a reflex of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_hipaR_ also means ‘sibling-in-law of the same sex’, except that further distinctions are made with other qualifying words. 


The latter pattern is so predominant in the available data for [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) systems that it seems fairly safe to infer that [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_ipaR_ meant ‘sibling-in-law of the same sex’, as was done by [Milke (1958)](Source#cldf:milke1958).  Milke's [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) reconstruction raises two questions: 1. What was the [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) term for ‘sibling-in-law of the opposite sex’?, 2. can the meaning ‘sibling-in-law of the same sex’ be attributed to [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_hipaR_?  Milke answered the first question by suggesting that ZH (w.s.) and HB were terminologically equated with the husband, and that BW (m.s.) and WZ were terminologically equated with the wife.  Whether such a system can be attributed to [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) is unclear.  The evidence suggests that relative sex played a crucial role in definition of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_hipaR_ (as it did in the system of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) sibling terms).  The distribution of reflexes over major [MP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) subgroups further suggests that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_hipaR_ probably meant ‘sibling-in-law of the same sex’ rather than ‘sibling-in-law of the opposite sex’, but an adequate reconstruction for the latter meaning remains to be found.",milke1958

[Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) compared both [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _híraw_ (above) and _hiláw_ ‘uncooked; green, unripe’ with [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _hijau_ and the related forms in [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577), [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432), and [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285), but it is now clear that [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _hiláw_ reflects earlier &ast;_hilaw_ ‘raw, unripe’.  However, the comparison of [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _híraw_ with the words for ‘green’ in other languages also presents difficulties (e.g. [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660) _hijo_ points to [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) &ast;_q-_, whereas [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _híraw_ points to [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) &ast;_h-_).

[Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) reconstructed &ast;_uRat_ ‘sinew; tendon; vein’ ( = Sehne, Ader), but the range of meanings assignable to [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) and [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) &ast;_uRat_ is actually much broader.

In either case it is clear that by at least [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) times &ast;_uRat_ was a key semantic category with numerous applications beyond the human body.

26585,*-i₁,i,imperative suffix,"[Egerod (1965)](Source#cldf:egerod1965) describes three ""passives"" for [Atayal](LanguageTable#cldf:493): (1) a ""relational passive"", (2) an ""indefinite passive"", and (3) a ""definite passive"".  The definite passive can occur in any of five aspects, of which the ""neutral definite passive"" is marked by _-an_, while the ""negatable neutral definite passive"" and the ""imperative definite passive"" are marked by _-i_.  The paradigmatic alternation of _-an_ and _-i_ thus appears to be common to at least [Atayal](LanguageTable#cldf:493) and [Bikol](LanguageTable#cldf:244).  The present affix evidently is identical to what [Wolff (1973:73)](Source#cldf:wolff1973) called the ""local passive dependent"" construction. It seems to have marked imperatives of a certain type, but may have been used with a wider range of construction types than I have indicated here.",egerod1965;wolff1973[73]
26586,*-i₂,i,local transitive suffix,"[Pawley (1973)](Source#cldf:pawley1973) initiated the discussion of this affix, which he called a ‘close transitive’ suffix, by drawing attention to similar functions which it performs both in [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) and in non-[Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082)  languages. [Starosta, Pawley, and Reid (1982:155)](Source#cldf:starostapawleyandreid1982) suggest that it derives from the generic locative marker &ast;_i_ which under certain conditions lost its prepositional function and was incorporated into the preceding verb in the separate histories of many Austronesian languages.  I concur with this interpretation, but note that it remains unexplained why the incorporation of such a preposition would not occur with intransitive as well as with transitive verbs.  


Judging from its widespread use as a verbal affix in [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) languages, it appears that the preposition &ast;_i_ had already become a suffix in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) (though at the same time it continued to function as a generic locative marker).  Because reflexes of &ast;_-i_ appear to be less common in non-[Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) languages, and because they sometimes co-occur with an active verb prefix (as in [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) and [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427)), it seems likely the verbal functions of &ast;_-i_ in [Wolio](LanguageTable#cldf:1124) developed independently from those in [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) and [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) -- in other words, that a suffix &ast;_-i_ ‘local transitive’, as distinct from the preposition &ast;_i_, did not exist in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) or [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081).  Moreover, in [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) languages the local transitive suffix &ast;_-i_ so commonly co-occurs with the incorporated 3sg. object pronoun &ast;_-a_ that the entire sequence &ast;_-ia_ (q.v.) must be posited as a functional unit for [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082).  Starosta, Pawley, and Reid appear to conflate &ast;_-i_ ‘local transitive’ and [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_-i_ ‘imperative suffix’, which I treat as separate.",pawley1973;starostapawleyandreid1982[155]

26420,*-ia,i,transitive and imperative suffix,"[Pawley (1973:120ff)](Source#cldf:pawley1973) has suggested that this form contains two morphemes: 1. &ast;_-i_ ‘close transitive’ and &ast;_-a_ ‘3sg. object’.  As partial justification for this analysis he points out that reflexes of &ast;_-a_ are suffixed directly to the verb in Bauan Fijian and, under certain conditions, in other [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) languages such as [Motu](LanguageTable#cldf:345) and [Roviana](LanguageTable#cldf:396).  While this analysis may be correct, the combined form &ast;_-ia_ is so widely reflected in such similar functions that it can be reconstructed independently of &ast;_-i_ or &ast;_-a_.  


Two facts associated with this etymon appear especially noteworthy: 


(1) Apart from the well-known problems associated with the ""thematic"" consonant that surfaces before reflexes of &ast;_-ia_ in many languages, [Motu](LanguageTable#cldf:345) and [Roviana](LanguageTable#cldf:396) agree in showing surface _-ia_ only after stems that end in _a_; following stems that end in _e_, _i_, _o_, or _u_, the semantically similar surface form is _-a_ ([Motu](LanguageTable#cldf:345): _ita-ia_ ‘to look at’, but _lare-a_ ‘to shoot an arrow’, _isi-a_ ‘to husk a coconut’, _hao-a_ ‘to awaken, arouse’, _utu-a_ ‘to draw water’; [Roviana](LanguageTable#cldf:396): _asa-ia_ ‘to grind, as an axe’, _lage-a_ ‘to fix a parrot to a perch’, _gili-a_ ‘to tickle gently’, _tapo-a_ ‘to grope or feel for, as in the dark’, _vatua-_ ‘to give’).  I know of nothing which would produce such an agreement through convergence, and therefore assume that in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) there was an alternation between &ast;_-ia_, following stem-final &ast;_a_, and &ast;_-a_, following other stem-final vowels.  One or the other variant appears to have been generalized in various languages; for convenience the two will be referred to as &ast;_-ia_. 


(2) Reflexes of &ast;_-ia_ function both as transitive suffixes and as imperative markers in several widely separated [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) languages.  In Eastern Polynesian languages reflexes of &ast;_-ia_ typically mark passive constructions, and also appear in certain types of imperatives (those that imply a goal or object). This association of passive and imperative appears to closely parallel the association of passive and ‘polite’ imperative associated with reflexes of &ast;_-en_ ‘goal focus, direct passive focus’ in many [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) languages.  While no one has yet argued that [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) had a passive construction marked by &ast;_-ia_, it apparently had an imperative construction marked in this manner.  The fact that the dual function of passive and imperative is associated with reflexes of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_-en_ in some [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) languages and with reflexes of [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_-ia_ in some [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) languages raises the question whether the passive function of &ast;_-ia_ might be far older than PEP.",pawley1973[120ff]

For arguments supporting &ast;_si ia_ (rather than &ast;_s-ia_), cf. [Blust (1977)](Source#cldf:blust1977). Although no reflexes of &ast;_ia_ are known in [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) languages, reflexes of &ast;_si ia_ in [Atayal](LanguageTable#cldf:493), [Saaroa](LanguageTable#cldf:974), and [Bunun](LanguageTable#cldf:250) clearly imply that &ast;_ia_ was present in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072), and it is posited here on this basis.",blust1977

Like &ast;_ia_ ‘exclamation’, this item almost certainly is identical with the 3sg. personal pronoun.  Historically pronouns often develop from demonstratives, but in the present case there can be little doubt that the primary sense of &ast;_ia_ was ‘3sg. personal pronoun’, and that both the exclamatory and the demonstrative meanings are semantic extensions (cf. the last three items above, where the demonstrative meaning is found in a word containing the fossilized personal article &ast;_si_).",

However, such vowel-final stems and stems that end in _ŋ_ appear to exhibit identical suffixed forms.  Phonemically, then, Cense's /_ia_/ could as well be /_iang_/.","cense1979;mills1975[1:78, 221]"

Although he did not note it, the [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432) form is irregular, and can better be compared with [Atayal](LanguageTable#cldf:493) _iani_ ‘this; here; now’, [Mansaka](LanguageTable#cldf:825) _y-ani_ ‘this’, [Nggela](LanguageTable#cldf:359) _iani_ ‘here’, probably reflecting &ast;_ia-ni_ ‘this; here’.  The inclusion of [Sa'a](LanguageTable#cldf:18945) _ie_ in Dempwolff's comparison is equally problematic.  Many [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) languages which have lost original final consonants (e.g. [Tolai](LanguageTable#cldf:19416), [Bugotu](LanguageTable#cldf:248), [Mota](LanguageTable#cldf:344), [Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434), [Niue](LanguageTable#cldf:362), [Samoan](LanguageTable#cldf:401), [Anuta](LanguageTable#cldf:229), and [Maori](LanguageTable#cldf:330)) have a demonstrative pronoun reflecting earlier &ast;_ia_.

As suggested by some grammarians and lexicographers (e.g. [Churchward 1959](Source#cldf:churchward1959)) these demonstrative uses, like the widespread exclamatory and confirmatory forms of similar shape, probably represent semantic extensions of the 3sg personal pronoun &ast;_ia_.",dempwolff193438;churchward1959

Although I believe that it is an improvement on Dempwolff, the cognate set proposed here is difficult for two reasons: (1) in most reflexes the proposed suffix &ast;_-an_ is fossilized (whereas the prefix &ast;_ka-_ in &ast;_ka-ibah-an_ is fossilized only in [Penan](LanguageTable#cldf:18658) _k-ivan_); (2) the meaning of reflexes ranges over ‘companion, friend’, same generation consanguines, same and adjacent generation affines, ‘clan’, and (at least in Philippine languages) ‘other, different’.  I assume that all of these senses are related through the notion ‘companion: the ""other"" in a personal dyad which includes the self’.  Dempwolff presumably would also have included forms that I assign to &ast;_iba iba_ ‘remainder, surplus’.  It is possible, but by no means certain,",dempwolff193438

[Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _ka-ilán_, [Tboli](LanguageTable#cldf:19175) _k-ilon_, Santa Catalina _ka-ita_ ‘when?’ may point to an additional affixed form &ast;_ka-ijan_.  In any event, it is clear that the initial consonant of [Tboli](LanguageTable#cldf:19175) _kilon_ is a fossilized affix rather than evidence for &ast;_qijan_, since both [Puyuma (Tamalakaw)](LanguageTable#cldf:18964) _a-ydan_ and [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573) _ŋa-iʔan_ contradict initial &ast;_q_.  


The reconstruction of &ast;_p-ijan_ is problematic.  In many languages reflexes of &ast;_ijan_ are confused with reflexes of &ast;_pija_ ‘how much? how many?’ (see above), and it is possible that &ast;_p-ijan_ is a monomorphemic product of contamination.

Similarly, the great majority of [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) languages (like [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573)) reflect a form with prefixed &ast;_ŋa-_, suggesting that [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_ŋaijan_ was monomorphemic.  Contrary to this interpretation, a few languages in the Solomons ([Mono-Alu](LanguageTable#cldf:19034), Santa Catalina) reflect &ast;_ijan_ without &ast;_ŋa-_.  Finally, both in [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314) and in [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573) a reflex of &ast;_ijan_ is commonly used together with a morpheme _nai_.  Attention to the glosses ([Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314) _nai_ ‘marker of past time’, [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573) _nai_ ‘where (relative), when (relative)’, however, suggests that this agreement is convergent, as apparently is that of [Buli](LanguageTable#cldf:249) _ma-fis_ ‘when (future)’, [Dobuan](LanguageTable#cldf:258) _ma-isa_ ‘when?’.",

Although linguistic evidence for the use of bark cloth in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) is not currently available, the bark of the paper mulberry tree (_Broussonetia papyrifera_) was pounded with a wooden or stone mallet into bark cloth by the Amis of eastern Taiwan until at least the first half of the twentieth century ([Chen 1988:143-145](Source#cldf:chen1988)).

To distinguish the two a rare body-part prefix &ast;_qa-_ (found also in  &ast;_qabaRa_ ‘shoulder’ and perhaps &ast;_qaqaqi_ ‘foot, leg’) was sometimes added to the word for ‘hand, arm’.  [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372) _chim_ ‘hand, arm, front paws (of animals)’ appears to reflect &ast;_qa-lima_.  Since the languages cited above, which fall into three widely divergent groups, all exhibit doublets with and without _l-_,  it is possible that the _ima_ variants are irregularly altered forms of &ast;_qa-lima_ rather than of &ast;_lima_.  


However, neither the reconstruction of &ast;_lima_, nor of &ast;_qa-lima_ makes it possible to explain the above data through regular sound change, and it appears necessary either to recognize widespread convergence of a seemingly unmotivated type, or to reconstruct a vowel-initial doublet.

26507,*<in>,i,perfective marker,"Both [Wolff (1973)](Source#cldf:wolff1973) and [Dahl (1976)](Source#cldf:dahl1976) reconstruct [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_-in-_ as a past tense marker which co-occurred with the active infix &ast;_-um-_, the instrumental passive &ast;_Si-_ and the local passive &ast;_-an_.  In the direct passive the relationship of &ast;_-in-_ to the verb is more complex.  Whereas the direct passive of non-past verbs was formed with &ast;_-en_, the direct passive of past verbs was formed with no suffix.  As a result the infix &ast;_-in-_ in the past tense of direct passive verbs acquired a kind of portmanteau function, signalling both the past tense and the passive voice inseparably.  This portmanteau function of &ast;_-in-_ is widespread in Austronesian languages, and was noted early in the 20th century by the Dutch linguist Hendrik Kern ([Kern 1913-28](bib-Kern)). 


 In contrast to Wolff and Dahl, [Starosta, Pawley, and Reid (1982)](Source#cldf:starostapawleyandreid1982) argue that &ast;_-in-_, along with other reconstructed affixes that function both as voice markers and as nominalizers in contemporary languages, were originally markers only of various types of nominalization.  To them it follows, then, that the widespread verbal uses of these affixes are historically secondary.  


In my view there is merit both in the position taken by Wolff and by Dahl (that the affixes in question were verbal inflections in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072)), and in the position taken by Starosta, Pawley, & Reid (that the same affixes were derivational devices for creating deverbal nouns).  If there is a shortcoming that is shared by the two approaches it is perhaps the implicit assumption that the [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) affixes &ast;_Si-_, &ast;_-in-_, &ast;_-an_, and &ast;_-en_ were _exclusively_ verbal or nominal. In fact, straightforward application of the comparative method seems to require the reconstruction both of verbs and of nouns marked with the same set of affixes in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072).  This leaves open the question whether at some still earlier period one of these functions might have developed out of the other. 

In [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) and [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) it is clear that at least pronominal agents (if not also nominal agents) and possessors were marked the same: e.g. [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_k-um-aen aku_ ‘I am eating’, but &ast;_kaen-en (ni) ku_ ‘is eaten by me, my eating’, &ast;_k-in-aen (ni) ku_ ‘was eaten by me, my eating’, &ast;_maCa (ni) ku_ ‘my eye’.  Given this identity of marking it would not be surprising for pattern pressure to favor the reinterpretation of non-AV verbal constructions as possessive nominals. Since no such pressure would favor the reinterpretation of possessive nominal constructions as non-AV verbals, I cannot agree with Starosta, Pawley, & Reid that the focus systems of modern [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) and Philippine languages probably evolved from earlier systems of nominalization.",wolff1973;dahl1976;starostapawleyandreid1982

Particularly salient is the richness of morphological devices used to mark the vocative (for discussion see [Blust 1979](Source#cldf:blust1979)).

26533,*isa₁,i,one,"The number ‘one’ is unique among numerals universally in that it alone tends to develop into an article.  Moreover, semantically the number ‘one’ carries something of the ""antithetical sense of primal words"" (to borrow a phrase from Freud): morphological derivatives in many languages refer both to unity (‘one with’) and to aloneness (‘one apart from’). The number ‘one’ is unique among Austronesian numerals in that it alone has reconstructed doublets (&ast;_esa_ and &ast;_isa_).  Moreover, in addition to these apparent stem variants a clitic form &ast;_sa-_ is found in some languages, including languages that lack the full numeral (e.g. [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _se-_ formative in _se-puluh_ ‘ten’, _se-ratus_ ‘100’, _se-ribu_ ‘1000’, etc., next to _satu_ ‘one’; [Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434) _ha_ ‘indefinite article: a, an, some, any’, next to _taha_ ‘one’).  


The following additional points should be noted: 1. it is unclear whether &ast;_isaq_ should be treated as morphologically complex (&ast;_isa-q_) or as a doublet (&ast;_isaq_), 2. &ast;_ma-isa_ ‘alone’ appears to contain the stative or attributive prefix &ast;_ma-_; [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _mag-isá_ ‘be alone, do something alone’, however, suggests that [Hanunóo](LanguageTable#cldf:273) _maysá_ may reflect &ast;_maR-isa_.  Such an interpretation is not available for [Sasak](LanguageTable#cldf:404), [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947), [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573), or [Yamdena](LanguageTable#cldf:1130), where &ast;_R_ did not regularly disappear, 3.  the nasal grade reflexes of &ast;_s_ (&ast;_insa_) in _Sulawesi_ and the Lesser Sunda islands are assumed to be a product of independent changes, 4. it is not clear whether a reflex of &ast;_esa_ or &ast;_isa_ survived in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082), although the clitic form &ast;_sa-_ evidently did.

The appropriateness of including some morphologically complex forms (as [Mandar](LanguageTable#cldf:813) _ma-issi_ and [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947) _paŋ-issi_) under &ast;_isi_ is questionable, but in these respects I have followed my sources.  Perhaps the most interesting feature of this comparison is its gloss.  


[Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) reconstructed &ast;_isi_ with the rather bland meaning ‘contents’.  Abstract ideas generally have their foundations in sense perceptions, and we might therefore expect the idea of ‘contents’ to be rooted in something more concrete.  This is the case with &ast;_isiʔ_, which meant ‘flesh’ in addition to ‘contents’.  Moreover, it is clear from witnesses as diverse as [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577), [Sasak](LanguageTable#cldf:404), [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947), [Rotinese](LanguageTable#cldf:395), and [Kei](LanguageTable#cldf:298) that ‘flesh’ must be taken in its broadest English sense: the meat of humans or animals (in contradistinction to the bone and fat) and the flesh of fruits (in contradistinction to the pit), or of vegetables.  


One recurrent reference to vegetable flesh is seen in [Kalamian Tagbanwa](LanguageTable#cldf:18285) _isi_ ‘flesh, meat; tuber’, [Ngadha](LanguageTable#cldf:357) _isi_ ‘flesh without bones and fat; tuber’, [Tetun](LanguageTable#cldf:1060) _talas isi-n_ ‘sweet potato roots’, _ubi isi-n_ ‘yam roots’, _isi-na ona_ ‘said when plants have produced tubers or when fruit is nearing maturity’, [Fordata](LanguageTable#cldf:18184) _ihi-n_ ‘flesh of tubers’, and the [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) proverb _diam ubi ada-ña ber-isi_ ""resting like a tuber that puts on flesh by rest"" = recuperative and profitable rest.  


From this broad sense of ‘flesh’ it appears that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_isiʔ_ referred to the useful part of a thing, or its ""essence"".  Intriguingly, this notion is extended to the blade of a knife or the point of an arrow both in [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) and in [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076) languages, where the extended referential range of &ast;_isiʔ_ appears to have competed with that of &ast;_mata_ ‘eye; focal point; most prominent part’.  In a similar vein the arrow is the _isi_ of the bow in Soboyo, and the bullet the _isi_ of the gun in [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427).  


In striking contrast with semantic categories typical of Indo-European  languages (cf. e.g. [Buck 1949](Source#cldf:buck1949)), reflexes of &ast;_isiʔ_ also referred to humans in two related senses: (1) residents (the &ast;_isiʔ_ of the house), (2) inhabitants (= the &ast;_isiʔ_ of the land).  Finally, it is noteworthy that although [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_penuq_ meant ‘full (as a container)’, the common verb meaning ‘to fill’ evidently was not based on &ast;_penuq_, but rather on &ast;_isiʔ_.  The existential meanings of reflexes in [Kanakanabu](LanguageTable#cldf:680), [Banjarese](LanguageTable#cldf:243), and [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432) are assumed to be products of convergence.",dempwolff193438;buck1949

30603,*kaen,k,eat,"This base is exceptionally rich in affix potential.  At the same time it has caused considerable confusion to some comparativists.  [Dempwolff (1938)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) posited &ast;_ka_ ‘to eat’, &ast;_ka-en_ ‘what is to be eaten, food, nourishment’, on the assumption that &ast;_kaen_ contained a base &ast;_ka_ plus the patient suffix &ast;_-en_.  However, this is a misanalysis, as the comparative evidence supports &ast;_kaen_ ‘to eat’ and &ast;_kaen-en_ ‘be eaten by someone; what is to be eaten, food, nourishment’.  [Wolff (2010:855-856)](Source#cldf:wolff2010), on the other hand, posits &ast;_kan_ ‘eat’, but has no explanation for the second vowel (or for vowel length) in widely separated languages such as [Bunun](LanguageTable#cldf:250), [Amis](LanguageTable#cldf:227), [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423), [Hanunóo](LanguageTable#cldf:273), various Bisayan and Manobo languages, [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314), [Sangir](LanguageTable#cldf:402), [Tondano](LanguageTable#cldf:1077), [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245), [Totoli](LanguageTable#cldf:1084), [Boano](LanguageTable#cldf:544), [Banggai](LanguageTable#cldf:238) and [Proto-Bungku-Tolaki](LanguageTable#cldf:19187).  Moreover, following a prior suggestion by Dahl he proposes &ast;_isekan_ ‘fish’ as a morphological derivative, although the comparative evidence points clearly to [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) _&ast;Sikan_, with last-syllable &ast;_a_, not &ast;_e_ (cp. [Bunun](LanguageTable#cldf:250) _iskan_ ‘fish’, vs. _kaʔun_ ‘eat’).  


The simplest explanation for these various confusions is that the base &ast;_kaen_ frequently contracted to a monosyllable because schwa next to another vowel is particularly weak, and tends to be absorbed.  This is especially the case with affixed forms, and an examination of almost any dictionary of a contemporary language shows that reflexes of the base &ast;_kaen_ rarely occur unaffixed, and that when they do they are more likely to retain the medial vowel sequence, as with [Aklanon](LanguageTable#cldf:226) _káon_ ‘to eat’, but _kán-on_ ‘rice, staple food’ (not &ast;&ast;_káon-on_).  Where &ast;_kaen_ has contracted to a monosyllable several languages independently have restored the favored disyllabism of content words through epenthesis, as in [Puyuma](LanguageTable#cldf:386) _əkan_, [Yami](LanguageTable#cldf:1131) _(a)kan_, [Bontok](LanguageTable#cldf:246) _ek-ekan_, KADAD _akan_, or [Maloh](LanguageTable#cldf:327) _aŋkan_ ‘eat’ (the latter with subsequent sporadic medial prenasalization). 


 The rich morphology of this base is ubiquitous in Taiwan, the Philippines, northern Borneo and northern Sulawesi, but contracts radically in languages further to the south, where only paradigmatically dissociated elements remain, as in the Uma Juman dialect of [Kayan](LanguageTable#cldf:294) ([Blust 1977:63-64](Source#cldf:blust1977)), where _kani_, _kanən_, _kinan_, _kuman_, _makan_, _pakan_, _pəŋanan_ and _pəŋuman_ are no longer anchored to a common base, and where most of the morphology in this fragmented paradigm is fossilized (_-ən_, _-in-_, _ma-_, _pa-_, _pəŋ-_ and _–an_ are otherwise unknown in the language, and although a reflex of &ast;_-um-_ continues to function as the marker of active voice, its form is _–əm-_, not _–um-_).  Similarly, for [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) [Hardeland (1859:276)](Source#cldf:hardeland1859) cites _kuman_ as a dictionary entry, and notes that “Das Passiv von _kuman_ is unregelmässig, heisst: _kinan_, gegessen, getrogen werden, (sind essbar).”",dempwolff193438;wolff2010[855-856];blust1977[63-64];hardeland1859[276]

As noted in [Blust (1987)](Source#cldf:blust1987) the most reasonable gloss for this challenging form is ‘men’s house’, that is, a dormitory for unmarried men.  According to [Fox (1993b:12)](Source#cldf:fox1993a) “This designation assumes, however, the existence of Melanesian type men’s houses among the early Austronesians prior to their contact with the non-Austronesian populations of New Guinea,” and he notes that “[Tryon (1993)](bib-Tryon), assigns &ast;_kalamiR_ the gloss, ‘granary, shed’.  It might therefore be appropriate to see the widespread [Western Malayo-Polynesian](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) reflexes as a retention and the usages found in Oceania as an innovation.” Quite apart from his repeated mis-citation of the form as &ast;_kalamiR_ (three times in a single 13-line paragraph), and his patently false assertion that “widespread [Western Malayo-Polynesian](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) reflexes” support the meaning ‘granary’, there are a number of problems with this statement.  First, Fox apparently fails to understand that &ast;_kamaliR_ must be reconstructed for [Proto-Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082), as this is the only gloss (apart from ‘man, male’ in the Admiralties) that reflexes of &ast;_kamaliR_ have in Oceanic languages.  But [Proto-Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) was spoken by a language community that had only recently arrived in the western Pacific, and that shows little influence from the Papuan languages that were already present in this region.  Second, in the context of the wider set of ‘house’ terms considered by [Blust (1987)](Source#cldf:blust1987) &ast;_lepaw_ is clearly a better [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) candidate for the meaning ‘granary’, as it is attested in this sense in both [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076) and [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) languages, whereas &ast;_kamaliR_ is attested in this meaning only in the Philippines.  Third, a search through [Tryon (1995)](Source#cldf:tryon1995) turns up no reference to ‘granary shed’, and hence no data that was not already considered in [Blust (1987)](Source#cldf:blust1987).  Fourth, Fox’s suggestion that bachelor’s houses were unknown to Austronesian speakers prior to reaching New Guinea is fundamentally at odds with the ethnographic evidence, since the institution of bachelor’s houses has been described for inter alia, the Amis, Tsou, Rukai and Puyuma of Taiwan ([Chen 1988:271ff](Source#cldf:chen1988)), the Lepanto and Bontok of northern Luzon ([Keesing 1962:121](Source#cldf:keesing1962), [Lebar 1975:83](Source#cldf:lebar1975)), the Modang of east Kalimantan (Guerreiro 1998), the Acehnese of northern Sumatra ([Loeb 1972:221ff](Source#cldf:loeb1972)), the Mentaweians just west of Sumatra ([Lebar 1972:42](Source#cldf:lebar1972)), the prehispanic Chamorros, Palauans, and Yapese of western Micronesia ([Alkire 1977:21, 30ff, 33ff](Source#cldf:alkire1977)) ), the Ende of central Flores ([Lebar 1972:87](Source#cldf:lebar1972)), the Sika of east Flores ([Lebar 1972:89](Source#cldf:lebar1972)), the Solorese of east Flores and Adonara ([Lebar 1972:92](Source#cldf:lebar1972)), and the Tanimbarese of the southern Moluccas ([Lebar 1972:112](Source#cldf:lebar1972)).  Surprisingly, [Green and Pawley (1999:55ff)](bib-Green) adopt the same position, concluding that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_kamaliR_ meant ‘granary’ despite the fact that this meaning is attested only within the Philippine subgroup, that the Greater Central Philippine languages of Sulawesi reflect it in other meanings, as ‘palace’ ([Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245)), or ‘boat house’ ([Sangir](LanguageTable#cldf:402), where, however, &ast;_R_ is reflected as /_r_/ instead of expected /_h_/), and that in some of the languages of northern Luzon, as [Kankanaey](LanguageTable#cldf:289), _kamálig_ describes a sleeping place used “mostly in the daytime.”




In conclusion, the great semantic diversity of reflexes makes it difficult to confidently reconstruct a gloss for [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_kamaliR_, but ‘men’s house’ seems by far the most plausible alternative, as special structures that serves both as dormitories for unmarried men and as men’s clubhouses are widely attested in traditional Austronesian-speaking societies, and [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_kamaliR_ could have had no other meaning.","lebar1975[104];blust1987;fox1993a;blust1987;tryon1995;blust1987;chen1988[271ff];keesing1962[121];lebar1975[83];loeb1972[221ff];lebar1972[42];alkire1977[21, 30ff, 33ff];lebar1972[87];lebar1972[89];lebar1972[92];lebar1972[112]"

The shape of this important grammatical morpheme is debatable.  [Lichtenberk (1985:117)](Source#cldf:lichtenberk1985) posited [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_ka-_, but this fails to account for the reflex of a nasal in [Seimat](LanguageTable#cldf:19050), [Manam](LanguageTable#cldf:328), [Pohnpeian](LanguageTable#cldf:381) or [Woleaian](LanguageTable#cldf:443).  In view of [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_kana_ ‘food’ it seems likely that the possessive classifier was itself a possessed noun, hence [Nggela](LanguageTable#cldf:359) _ga-ŋgu vundi_ ‘my banana’ (to eat) < [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_kana-gu pudi_ ‘my food (which is a) banana’.  Like many grammatical morphemes that have high text frequency, &ast;_kana_ in possessive constructions was shortened to _ka-_ in most languages.  This word is ultimately related to a suffixed form of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_kaen_ ‘to eat’, but its rather independent development in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) merits an independent entry.",lichtenberk1985[117]

Although all of these forms are clearly related, a specific reconstruction is hard to pin down.  The common element is &ast;_rawa_, but this rarely occurs alone or in combinations that would allow it to be extracted as a morpheme.

This word is in competition with the more widely-distributed [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_sakaRu_ ‘coral reef’, and it remains unclear what difference of meaning might have distinguished them.

The connection with ‘cloth’ in [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279), [Nias](LanguageTable#cldf:361), [Balinese](LanguageTable#cldf:235) and [Muna](LanguageTable#cldf:350) probably arose through protohistoric trade contacts in which bolts of cloth were stored on sticks or racks.  [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) _sa-ŋa-káyo_ ‘one piece (of cloth)’ appears to contain the same numeral ligature found in _sa-ŋa-púlo_ ‘ten’ and _sa-ŋa-gasút_ ‘one hundred’, but the other languages cited point instead to &ast;_sa-ŋ-_, and the exact form of this reconstruction therefore remains somewhat in doubt.",

This comparison raises several questions. First, [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_iSu_ is already a well-established reconstruction for the 2sg independent pronoun, supported by at least a small subset of Formosan and Philippine languages. This has long raised the question what functional difference might have distinguished these two partially identical forms. [Blust (1977:8)](Source#cldf:blust1977) suggested that &ast;_i-kaSu_ was a polite substitute for &ast;_iSu_, and [Ross (2006:539-540)](bib-Ross) has tentatively accepted this interpretation, suggesting that it contains a prefix &ast;_ka-_ which has the same origin as the initial consonant of &ast;_k-ita_ ‘we pl. incl.’, &ast;_k-ami_ ‘we pl. excl.’ and the like. However, the appearance of [Bunun](LanguageTable#cldf:250) _asu_ raises the prospect that the base might have been vowel-initial. 



Entirely apart from these issues, a few languages in Borneo, representing the Kenyah and Melanau groups, appear to retain a reflex of the medial consonant as glottal stop, although the expected _-h-_ in Philippine languages that retain this phoneme is nowhere present. Finally, in many languages the personal article &ast;_i_, used with first and second persons, has fossilized on the base, largely because _&ast;h_ tended to drop, and when the resulting sequence _–au_ resyllabified as _–aw_, it produced a monosyllabic content morpheme that is highly disfavored in most Austronesian languages. Note that [Sarawak Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:801) _kau_ appears to be disyllabic, and that the [Kenyah](LanguageTable#cldf:300), BERAW and Melanau forms, which retain a disyllabic reflex of the base, do not have a fossilized article attached. The fossilized article &ast;_i-_ appears to be rare in CMP languages, although [Lamboya](LanguageTable#cldf:19339) (western Sumba) _y-au_ regularly reflects [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_i-kahu_. 



[Dempwolff (1938)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) assigned reflexes of [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_koe_/_i-koe_ to [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_kahu_, but the morphological relationship of these forms has never been satisfactorily explained (the similar shape of [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660) _ko-we_ ‘2sg.’, cited by Dempwolff, presumably is convergent). [Pawley (1972:62)](Source#cldf:pawley1972) posited [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_i-koe_ ‘1sg. focal pronoun’, [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_iko_, &ast;_koe_ ‘1sg. object pronoun’. Although the latter may be a shortened form of &ast;_i-koe_, it is compared directly with [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) _&ast;i-kahu_ here, since this is formally and semantically straightforward.

This form is semantically unusual in some languages, as [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), where it carries an inherently passive sense without the need for passive morphology in constructions such as _mata saya kena abu_ ‘ashes got in my eye’ (my eye was struck by ashes), or _banyak anak-anak kena penyakit cacar_ ‘many children fell sick with smallpox.’  Given the glosses in some modern languages it seems likely that its basic meaning in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) was ‘be ensnared, caught in a trap’, the suddenness, unexpectedness, negativity, and non-agency of the event being essential experiential features that carry over to many other situations.  


Although my initial impulse was to separate the meanings relating to being struck or affected by forces beyond one’s control from those carrying the sense ‘true, correct’, it became apparent as more examples were collected that these meanings are extremes of a continuum in which the connecting link is ‘to hit the mark’ (= ‘get it right’).

This comparison is imperfect, since the [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) form indicates &ast;_kezap kezap_, while the [Kayan](LanguageTable#cldf:294) and [Bintulu](LanguageTable#cldf:242) forms point to &ast;_kezep kezep_. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is borrowing from [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326).  However, as the [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) word shows, [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) loans in Philippine languages normally come from the Brunei dialect, in which &ast;_e_ had already merged with &ast;_a_.  Moreover, as shown below, there is a pattern of reduplicated forms, most of which begin with &ast;_k_, representing the meanings ‘flicker, of flames; blinking, of eyes’ in many languages, thus increasing the probability that _kuráp-kuráp_ and _kəjəp kəjəp_ continue an inherited pattern.



The reduplication in this form is clearly iconic of the repetitive brightening and dimming of a flickering fire, a pattern that is also shown by unrelated forms that use reduplication to express the same meaning, as with [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) _ag-kudre-kudrép_ ‘flicker’ (< _kudrép_ ‘dim; overcast; obscure; indistinct’), _ag-patáy-patáy_ ‘flicker’ (< _patáy_ ‘death’), [Bikol](LanguageTable#cldf:244) _kimát-kimát_ ‘flickering, twinkling; shimmering; blinking; twitching’, _mag-kimát-kimát_ ‘to flicker, twinkle; to shimmer; to twitch or blink (the eye)’, [Mansaka](LanguageTable#cldf:825) _kilam-kilam_ ‘to sparkle; to flame; to flash; to glisten’, [Tiruray](LanguageTable#cldf:433) _kemat-kemat_ ‘flickering’, [Kiput](LanguageTable#cldf:18958) _kidəp- kidəp_ ‘to blink (involuntarily); to flicker, of flames’, [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276) _kesap-kesap_ ‘blink, winking’, [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _ter-kelip-kelip_ ‘twinkling; shimmering; blinking’, [Balinese](LanguageTable#cldf:235) _kijap-kijep_ ‘blink the eyes’, [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947) _maʔ-millo-millo_ ‘to flicker, of a small flame’, etc.  The meanings ‘flicker’ and ‘blink’ are related through the rapid alternation of brightening and dimming, whether at the source of light, or at the source of perception.",

Under most circumstances the formal similarity of the material cited here to [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) _kilála_ ‘ornamental shrub, the reddish leaves of which have medicinal use: _Cordyline fruticosa_, would be passed over in silence.  However, reflexes of &ast;_kilala_ in the southeast Solomons refer to knowledge obtained by divination, and one of the charms used in divination is the leaves of dracaena, a close relative of the _Cordyline_, suggesting that this plant may have have been used for a similar purpose (knowledge through divination) in the pre-Christian Philippines, but that these associations were purged in the process of Christianization.




To explain the correspondence of the [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423), [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) and [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432) forms cited here [Dempwolff (1938)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) reconstructed &ast;_lala_, segmenting the first syllable of both the [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) and [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) forms.  Wider comparison shows that this is not the optimal solution, since most languages reflect a trisyllable, and the development in [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432) must be considered an unexplained irregularity.  The recurrent _kila_ forms ([Mapun](LanguageTable#cldf:19176), [Mussau](LanguageTable#cldf:352), [Roviana](LanguageTable#cldf:396), [Toak](LanguageTable#cldf:19518), [Wayan](LanguageTable#cldf:19060), [Fijian](LanguageTable#cldf:266), optionally in [Nggela](LanguageTable#cldf:359)) are assumed to be products of haplology rather than reflexes of a [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) doublet.",dempwolff193438

30923,*-ku,k,1sg genitive (marker of non-subject agency and possession; my; by me),"This is clearly the ‘short form’ of &ast;_aku_ ‘1sg nominative’, but since the two shapes are not related by a morphological process (unless one appeals in a somewhat ad hoc fashion to subtractive morphology) they are documented separately.  Most Formosan data cited here is from [Ross (2006)](bib-Ross).  As noted in [Blust (1977)](Source#cldf:blust1977), prenasalized forms of &ast;_-ku_ reflect &ast;_ni-kú_ (&ast;_ni_ ‘genitive case marker for singular human referents + &ast;-ku ‘1sg gen.’), in which the unstressed vowel of &ast;ni was lost, followed by nasal place assimilation.  It seems clear that this change had already taken place in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082), where reflexes of the genitive pronouns function only to indicate possessors, and never agents.  However, in [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) languages the reduction of &ast;_ni-kú_ to _-ŋku_ may have happened at different times across a wide range of languages, and it is therefore assumed that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) still had &ast;_ni-kú_).



In [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) and many of its descendants, whether indicated in the glosses given here or not, the possessive pronouns are suffixed to directly possessed (‘inalienably possessed’) nouns, such as most body parts and kin terms, the words for ‘name’ and ‘shadow, reflection (soul)’, and perhaps a few others, while they are suffixed to a possessive classifier for indirect possession, usually distinguishing edible, drinkable and general possession, but sometimes further refinements (as in Vanuatu), or fewer (as just edible and general in western Melanesia).",blust1977

This widely, if somewhat sparsely distributed comparison, provides the key linguistic evidence that a continuous tradition of pottery-making connects speakers of Proto-Austronesian, c. 5500-6000 BP with Pacific populations as far east as western Polynesia, about three millennia later.  In many areas pottery has been lost, and with it a term for ‘clay cooking pot’.  This is particularly true in the Pacific, including scattered areas in Melanesia and all of Polynesia, although it is clear that Proto-Polynesian speakers had pottery, and lost it within a few centuries of settling western Polynesia.  Pottery-making was also lost occasionally, but much less commonly, in insular Southeast Asia.  



For [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) aborigines, [Chen (1988:110)](Source#cldf:chen1988) reports the manufacture of pottery among the  [Bunun](LanguageTable#cldf:250), [Tsou](LanguageTable#cldf:1087),  [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370), [Amis](LanguageTable#cldf:227) and [Yami](LanguageTable#cldf:1131), adding that only the last two groups still made it in the late 1960s, but he does not distinguish cases in which there is positive evidence for its absence from cases in which it simply unreported.  Although pottery leaves perhaps the single most salient signature in the archaeological record of any item of material culture, owing both to its durability and its sheer quantity, the available linguistic evidence sheds no light on such centrally important archaeological topics as the origin of the Lapita decorative style.



In several Western Malayo-Polynesian languages, including  [Tiruray](LanguageTable#cldf:433), [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660),  [Balinese](LanguageTable#cldf:235), Southern Toraja and  [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325), a reflex of &ast;_kuden_, either simple or affixed, refers not only to clay cooking pot, but also to such concepts as spouse, household, and the nuclear family.  These forms suggest that the clay cooking pot  almost certainly the vessel in which rice was boiled for the daily meal  became a metaphor of commensality, and hence of the union of man and wife in the nuclear family unit.",chen1988[110]

Although the reflexes of this term refer to various types of groupers or rod cod, certain clues suggest that &ast;_kuRapu_ referred specifically to the giant grouper.  This is one of the largest of all reef fish, reaching a maximum length of nearly nine feet, and a weight of some 880 pounds.  Whether they are dangerous to humans or not, fish of this size that are readily encountered in the vicinity of coral reefs, must leave a strong visual and psychological impression on divers, and this is implied by comments in the glosses for [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _kerapu_ and [Arosi](LanguageTable#cldf:485) _ʔurahu_, each of which states that the giant grouper or rock cod is the subject of legends and tales.

The general semantic evolution of &ast;_lahud_ is quite rich.  From an original narrow sense ‘toward the sea’ the marine element has been generalized to mean ‘sea’ in Central Philippine languages generally ([Bikol](LanguageTable#cldf:244), [Aklanon](LanguageTable#cldf:226), [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252), etc.), [Binukid](LanguageTable#cldf:19012), the Malayic languages, [Balinese](LanguageTable#cldf:235), [Sangir](LanguageTable#cldf:402), [Buginese](LanguageTable#cldf:239), [Kambera](LanguageTable#cldf:678), [Hawu](LanguageTable#cldf:405), [Wetan](LanguageTable#cldf:1118),  and [Tolai](LanguageTable#cldf:19416). Although [Topping, Ogo and Dungca (1975)](bib-Topping) give only the cardinal direction meanings, Brant 
Songsong assures me that this word still retains its sense of ‘toward the sea’, as in the expression _lagu para i tasi_, said regardless of which cardinal direction the sea might be from a given location.





Moreover, in some of these languages, as those of the central Philippines, it refers specifically to the high or open seas as opposed to littoral waters.  In other languages, especially those whose speakers came to reside in high inland regions, the contrastive elevation of &ast;_lahud_ was extended to encompass the general meaning of ‘lower, at a lower altitude’, in some cases entirely losing its marine associations.  In [Thao](LanguageTable#cldf:1062) of central Taiwan, for example,  _raus_ refers to a downhill, or downward direction from the mountains, with no particular reference to the sea, in [Hanunóo](LanguageTable#cldf:273) of the north-central Philippines _láwud_ refers to the lowland regions, but so far as the available data indicate, not necessarily to the sea, and in [Bare'e](LanguageTable#cldf:236)  (or Pamona) of central Sulawesi _lau_ refers to any place that lies lower than the speaker at the time of reference, evidently with no connection to the sea as a feature of orientation.  


Finally, [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) _olo laut_, [Hawu](LanguageTable#cldf:405) _dou lou_ and no doubt similar collocations in other languages for which insufficient data is to hand suggest that once settled in a given location, AN speakers tended to conceive of anyone who arrived by sea as a foreigner, or stranger.",

First, [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372) sits on the Sunda shelf along with Borneo and the other Greater Sunda islands,and so has a native porcupine ([Darlington 1980:390](Source#cldf:darlington1980)).  Second, there is no obvious reason why a [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) word would be borrowed to designate a native animal.  It is most plausible to assume, then, that the porcupine was first encountered by Austronesian speakers moving south from Taiwan when they reached Palawan,  and the name that was innovated for it there was preserved as they continued to expand southward.  In some areas, however, the name for this animal was replaced by a reflex of &ast;_taRutuŋ_ ‘porcupine fish’.",darlington1980[390]

This word has a wide range of associations.  In most languages it seems to have referred not only to the  physical sky, but also to a mythological realm of spirits, and reflexes in at least [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276) and [Sundanese](LanguageTable#cldf:418) suggest that the concept of a celestial spirit realm embodied the notion of seven levels, a concept that was reported in a slightly different form in early sources on [Chuukese](LanguageTable#cldf:1086).  In many parts of the Pacific reflexes of this term refer to weather phenomena, such as rain or wind, either together with the meaning ‘sky’ or without it.  Forms in some languages of Vanuatu, as [Central Maewo](LanguageTable#cldf:376) _tae-laŋi_ and [Mafea](LanguageTable#cldf:772) _tai-laŋi_ apparently reflect &ast;_taqe laŋi_ ‘cloud’ (lit. ‘feces of sky’).

Reconstruction of this word raises several formal issues, and suggests cultural practices that reach beyond linguistic reconstruction.



[Dyen (1947, 1953)](bib-Dyen) posited [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_leyqa_ ‘ginger’ in order to account for the penultimate vowel of forms such as [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) _luyʔá_, but this proposal confuses an innovative doublet &ast;_luqia_ in Proto-Greater Central Philippines with reflexes of &ast;_laqia_. Apart from these deviant forms, a number of languages have disyllabic words that appear to reflect &ast;_lia_. In some cases ([Kelabit](LanguageTable#cldf:299), [Kenyah](LanguageTable#cldf:300), [Bintulu](LanguageTable#cldf:242), [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276), etc.) these can be derived by regular change from &ast;_laqia_ through reduction of the first-syllable vowel to schwa, which then deleted along with the following glottal stop, but in Oceanic languages such as [Kwaio](LanguageTable#cldf:307) or [Sa'a](LanguageTable#cldf:18945)  this does not work, and forms such as [Kwaio](LanguageTable#cldf:307) _lia_ or [Sa'a](LanguageTable#cldf:18945) _lie_ must therefore be regarded either as irregular reductions of &ast;_laqia_, or as evidence for a possible doublet &ast;_lia_. 



The cultural role of ginger is particularly interesting.  Apart from its use as a condiment in cooking, the glosses in several languages show that this plant was used for medicinal purposes from an early time.  In this function it evidently was chewed and spewed with saliva onto the afflicted part, as shown in the glosses for [Sangir](LanguageTable#cldf:402) and [Rotinese](LanguageTable#cldf:395) _lia_. Similar descriptions appear in ethnographic accounts.  [Fortune (1963:295)](Source#cldf:fortune1963), for example, notes that among the Dobuans of western Melanesia sorcerors regularly chew ginger and spray it out in practicing sorcery as well as curative medicine: “It is chewed with many healing incantations, apart from the tabu exorcisms which are breathed into water for bathing the patient.  With other healing spells it is spat on the seat of illness.  The sight of a magician chewing ginger, spitting it onto the object charmed at intervals, and muttering his spell at the same time is a common one at Dobu … It is chewed in all the incantations to ward off a squall at sea and spat towards the lowering squall.  It is chewed and bespattered over the canoe, in lashing it with incantation, making it speedy and seaworthy…”.



The puzzling [Lakalai](LanguageTable#cldf:877) gloss, which combines ginger with prowess as a warrior is further illuminated by remarks in [Codrington (1972:133)](Source#cldf:codrington1972) regarding cultural practices on the island of Florida in the central Solomons.  A man who is about to go out on a vendetta against his private enemy “will pull up his ginger-plant, and judge from the ease with which it comes out of the earth whether he shall succeed or not; he will make his sacrifice, and with the ginger and leaves on his shield and in his belt and right armlet will go to fight.”  As in Dobu, a curer (195) “will chew ginger and blow into the patient’s ears and on that part of the skull which is soft in infants, will call on the name of the _tindalo_, (ghost) and beg him to remove the sickness.”



Judging from the glosses in [Rotinese](LanguageTable#cldf:395) and [Kei](LanguageTable#cldf:298) in eastern Indonesia ginger provided a stimulant for various kinds of purposes.  In particular it evidently was given to dogs to make them more vigorous in hunting.  The gloss in [Rotinese](LanguageTable#cldf:395) and the above quote from Fortune on the Dobuans suggest that it was also chewed and spat upon inanimate objects, as a fishing net or canoe to make them more efficacious.  These varied uses are all perhaps united by a common thread: given its stimulating taste ginger evidently was conceived as a plant that could impart vitality to other objects, either when chewed and expectorated upon them, as in healing or improving the efficacy of tools such as nets or canoes, or when fed directly to an animal, as in improving the hunting acuity of dogs.  When used to confront something negative, as a storm, its supposed supernatural powers act to counter the undesirable effects.",fortune1963[295];codrington1972[133]

As with the parallel discrepancy in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_balija_ or &ast;_baRija_ ‘weavers sword’ the [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) languages indicate &ast;_R_ as the initial consonant of this item, while the [MP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) languages indicate &ast;_l_.  I have posited several morphologically complex forms of &ast;_laRiw_, although a distinctive meaning is not always apparent for these, as with &ast;_ma-laRiw_.  The form &ast;_pa-laRiw_ requires special comment, as its reflexes have survived in some languages when a reflex of &ast;_laRiw_ has not.  In languages such as [Tiruray](LanguageTable#cldf:433), [Wolio](LanguageTable#cldf:1124) and [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573) ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094)), [Tetun](LanguageTable#cldf:1060) ([CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076)), and [Numfor](LanguageTable#cldf:364) ([South Halmahera-West New Guinea](LanguageTable#cldf:20002)), the morpheme boundary that is recognized is purely historical, and is marked by = to distinguish it from the similar synchronic morpheme boundary in forms such as [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _lari_, _pe-lari_. 


It is an interesting question why the morpheme boundary should have been lost more commonly in reflexes of &ast;_pa-laRiw_ than in reflexes of other morphologically complex forms of &ast;_laRiw_.  One might argue that affixes differed in how tightly they were bound to the stem.  However, this should be generally true and not specific to particular lexical items.  Moreover, just what tightness of binding might mean is obscure except in terms of text frequency.  Perhaps &ast;_pa-laRiw_ occurred with particularly high text frequency because it not only signaled the abstract notion of flight or escape, but also the actor (""fugitive; one who has eloped"").  In some descendants of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) reflexes of &ast;_pa-laRiw_ may have occurred with higher text frequency than reflexes of &ast;_laRiw_, thus favoring the survival of the bi-morphemic word even when the stem itself passed out of use.",dempwolff193438

Only a portion of the _layu_-expressions relating to death in [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947) have been cited here, and it is quite clear that this group, which is known for its elaborate mortuary rites, maintained a rich association of the idea of withering or wilting in the plant world with that of death in the human world, perhaps initially through euphemism.",

Both ‘field hut’ and ‘granary’ also occur with reflexes of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;sapaw, but the distribution of meanings across major subgroups clearly favors &ast;_sapaw_ in the meaning ‘field hut’.  Reflexes in [Kelabit](LanguageTable#cldf:299) and [Kayan](LanguageTable#cldf:294) raise the prospect that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_lepaw_ could have referred both to field huts (when unqualified) and to granaries (when qualified by a word for ‘rice’).  However, since this inference is not supported by converging lines of evidence from both WMP and CMP languages it is best treated as a speculation.  The similar semantic profiles of &ast;_lepaw_ and &ast;_sapaw_ strongly suggest that rice granaries were simple structures that did not differ significantly from field huts which were used for temporary residence when working in the fields away from the village for several days in succession.",blust1987

Based on the comparison [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _lindól_ : [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285) _linḍu_ ‘earthquake’, [Dempwolff (1938)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) reconstructed &ast;_linḍuγ_ ‘earthquake’, but he was forced to acknowledge that the sound correspondence supporting the final consonant is irregular, [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) pointing to &ast;_lindul_ or &ast;_lindur_, but [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285) to &ast;_lindu_ or &ast;_linduR_ (ignoring the &ast;_d_/_ḍ_ distinction, which is no longer regarded as valid).  Access to apparently related forms from a much larger selection of languages now permits the reconstruction of both &ast;_linduR_ and the disjunct &ast;_lindur_, although neither of these is a competitor of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_linuR_ ‘earthquake’.  At first glance [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) _luni_ and Philippine forms such as [Agta (Central Cagayan)](LanguageTable#cldf:465), [Balangaw](LanguageTable#cldf:509) _lunig_ suggest a [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) doublet &ast;_luniR_, but closer attention to northern Luzon forms indicates that they probably reflect &ast;_lunij_.

In addition to reflexes that conform to expectation this list shows that there is a surprising number of apparently related forms that do not.  Some of these might be taken as evidence for doublets, as [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) _lúsaʔ_, [Loniu](LanguageTable#cldf:321) _lus_ < [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_lusehaq_, or [Kapampangan](LanguageTable#cldf:291) _liyas_, [Kayan](LanguageTable#cldf:294) _liah_, [Mori Atas](LanguageTable#cldf:19280) _liʔoho_ < [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_liqesah_. However, the evidence for a variant &ast;_lusehaq_ currently seems too tenuous to take seriously, and apparent reflexes of &ast;_liqesah_ are probably best treated as products of convergent metathesis.  Forms such as [Bare'e](LanguageTable#cldf:236) _lioso_, [Mori Atas](LanguageTable#cldf:19280) _liʔoho_ also suggest that the merger of &ast;_e_ (schwa) and &ast;_a_ before a final laryngeal had not yet taken place in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) (hence [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_liseheq_/_liseqeh_).  However, since all other languages point to [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_-aq_ or &ast;_-ah_ in this form, and a similar merger is supported by other etymologies, I will assume that the second rounded vowel in these Sulawesian forms is a product of assimilation to the regular reflex of &ast;_e_ in penultimate position.  


Finally, several widely separated languages ([Tboli](LanguageTable#cldf:19175), [Yakan](LanguageTable#cldf:1129), [Bare'e](LanguageTable#cldf:236), [Komodo](LanguageTable#cldf:708), plus the irregular [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325) form _ku-licca_) reflect the base reconstructed here with a prefix &ast;_ku-_ of unknown function.

I assume that [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) _ḍeluaq_ ~ _luaq_ ‘sound of vomiting’, _pa-ḍeluaq_ ‘make sounds of vomiting’ is unrelated, and that the final _–i_ and _–ki_ of various Polynesian reflexes is a fossilization of the [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) transitive suffixes &ast;_-i_ and &ast;_-aki_(ni), presumably motivated by a need to distinguish a large number of historically expected homophones with the base shape _lua_. Although reflexes of &ast;_luaq_ have come to mean ‘vomit’ in a large number of widely scattered languages, it is clear that [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) and [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_utaq_ ‘vomit; vomitus’, &ast;_um-utaq_ ‘to vomit’ referred to the regurgitation of food from the stomach, while [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_luaq_ evidently referred to ejecting something undesirable or useless from the mouth, as the pits of fruits, food or medicine that has an unexpectedly foul taste, the reddened saliva and pulp of the areca nut, etc.",

However, the attempt to unite reflexes of &ast;_ludaq_ and &ast;_dulaq_ under a single etymon with metathesized variants in some languages quickly falls apart, since a number of languages ([Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423), [Tiruray](LanguageTable#cldf:433), [Tombonuwo](LanguageTable#cldf:19188), [Dusun Deyah](LanguageTable#cldf:590), possibly [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432)) have an apparent reflex of &ast;_dulaq_ with a medial /_r_/ that cannot be traced to a single etymological source.  Finally, Dempwolff noted [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) _luja_ ‘spittle (after it is expectorated)’ as an irregular reflex of &ast;_ludaq_, but this can now be assigned to a tentative [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) doublet &ast;_luzaq_ based only on evidence from languages either currently spoken in Borneo ([Kanowit](LanguageTable#cldf:290), [Ba’amang](LanguageTable#cldf:18939), [Kapuas](LanguageTable#cldf:687)) or historically deriving from Borneo (Sama-Bajaw), but not subgrouping closely together.",dempwolff193438

In others the semantics are slightly skewed, as in [Sebop](LanguageTable#cldf:997) _atə-n_ ‘eye’, _laŋit_ ‘sky’, _atə-n laŋit_ ‘sun’ (‘eye of the sky’).  Some ‘eye’ expressions are extremely widespread in Austronesian languages, as those for ‘sun’, ‘nipple of the breast’, ‘spring of water’, and the like, while others are confined to a single language or discrete subgroup, as with Polynesian forms for ‘raindrop’ that reflect Proto-Polynesian &ast;_mata ʔuha_.  The range of metaphorical or quasi-metaphorical extensions of ‘eye’ given here is no doubt incomplete, but should serve to indicate the exceptional richness of abstract uses for this body-part, a richness that derives universally from the eye as the first part of the human anatomy on which infants focus, and which therefore becomes for all humans a focal point for anything important or essential ([Blust 2011](Source#cldf:blust2011)).



The use of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_nu_ as the genitive marker in expression such as &ast;_mata nu susu_ ‘nipple of the breast’ or &ast;_mata nu wahiR_ ‘spring of water, source of a river’ might be questioned, since most of the languages for which these expressions have been recorded have no genitive marker, and --- with few exceptions --- those that do have a form of the genitive that is different from &ast;_nu_.  However, other evidence indicates that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) had three genitive markers: &ast;_nu_ ‘genitive of common nouns’, &ast;_ni_ ‘genitive of singular personal nouns’ and &ast;_na_ ‘genitive of plural personal nouns’, and this would lead us to expect that the marker in ‘eye’ constructions would have been &ast;_nu_, even if no trace of it is preserved in the languages cited here.  [Proto-Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082), on the other hand, evidently replaced &ast;_nu_ with &ast;_ni_, as this is consistently reflected in different primary branches of the Oceanic subgroup ([Nggela](LanguageTable#cldf:359), [Kwaio](LanguageTable#cldf:307), [Ulawa](LanguageTable#cldf:1095), [Gilbertese](LanguageTable#cldf:614), [Wayan](LanguageTable#cldf:19060), [Fijian](LanguageTable#cldf:266)).",blust2009[313-314];blust2011

Although Dempwolff's morphological analysis almost certainly is correct, it is complicated by the virtual absence of known reflexes of the unaffixed base.  


Two candidates supporting a bimorphemic analysis are known to me: 1. [Puyuma (Tamalakaw)](LanguageTable#cldf:18964) _ma-iRa_, _i-ka-iRa_ ‘ashamed’, 2. [Hanunóo](LanguageTable#cldf:273) _hígaʔ_ ‘type of crab having red eyes’.  Both of these candidates for the unaffixed base are problematic, the [Puyuma](LanguageTable#cldf:386) form because it contains an unexpected zero reflex of &ast;_-q_, the [Hanunóo](LanguageTable#cldf:273) form because it is unique in the _Philippines_.

There are indications that sulphur had native medicinal uses, and the abundance of the material on Java would have made this island an important source of sulphur for areas in which it was absent (Borneo) or rare (Sulawesi).  


Reflexes of &ast;_maliraŋ_ show a distribution which is difficult to explain as a product of borrowing.  I assume, then, that &ast;_maliraŋ_ was found in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081), and that &ast;_baliraŋ_ was innovated (through a sporadic sound change) in a language ancestral to [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285), and some other languages of _western Indonesia_.

Its original reference, insofar as it can be inferred from the available data, was to the shade or shadow produced by objects, particularly those that gave shelter or protection from the sun, as trees or buildings.  Over time this evolved in some of the Polynesian languages into a more abstract sense of protection, which ultimately could be applied to the social protection provided by persons of power or authority within the community, and even to the individual who provided such protection, as with [Maori](LanguageTable#cldf:330) _whaka-maru-maru_ ‘protector, chief’.  If its original sense included not only protection from the sun, but also protection from wind and rain the meaning ‘lee of an island’, which is attested both in [Arosi](LanguageTable#cldf:485) of the southeast Solomons, and in [Nukuoro](LanguageTable#cldf:363) may also have been associated with this form in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082).",

The basic sense of this term was clearly ‘to chew something that one does not intend to swallow’.  In island Southeast Asia the usual application is to chewing betel nut, but what may be an older usage is widespread in Oceanic languages and appears occasionally farther west, and that is the practice of premasticating food for an infant (sometimes applied to the habit of birds in regurgitating food for nestlings, but more commonly applied to humans).  The agreement of [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) _meme_ with [Nehan](LanguageTable#cldf:888) _mem_ would appear to support a [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) doublet &ast;_meme_, but until more substantial evidence for [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_e_ becomes available this comparison will be treated as a product of chance convergence.",

27183,*na₂,n,linker marking emphatic attribution,"Both &ast;_a_ and &ast;_na_ must be reconstructed as linkers between [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) nominal heads and their lexical or phrasal attributes.  The question naturally arises what relationship these forms had.  In some attested languages ([Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423), [Bikol](LanguageTable#cldf:244)) _na_ is one of two phonologically conditioned allomorphs of a single morpheme, and it is conceivable that a similar relationship existed for [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_a_ and &ast;_na_.  


What is striking about the distribution of these forms is that outside _Taiwan_ reflexes have never been reported in the same language (thus some languages reflect &ast;_a_, while others reflect &ast;_na_). However, in [Thao](LanguageTable#cldf:1062) of central _Taiwan_ reflexes of both &ast;_a_ and &ast;_na_ are found as fully functional linkers.  While native speakers insist that _a_ and _na_ are ‘the same’, grammaticality judgements for phrases which contain one or the other particle show that they are not fully interchangeable.  In a handful of critical examples it is reasonably clear that _a_ signals what might be called ‘neutral’ or ‘unmarked’ attribution (e.g. _ma-tubu a saran_ ‘a wet road’ = ‘wet LINK road’, while _na_ signals what might be called ‘contrastive’ or ‘emphatic’ attribution (e.g.  Q: ‘which road did you come on?’, A: _ma-tubu na saran_ ‘the WET road’).  Since [van der Tuuk (1971 [1864-1867])](bib-van) also treats the [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) linker or relativizer _na_ as an ‘emphasizer’ it appears likely that the situation in [Thao](LanguageTable#cldf:1062) is conservative, reflecting a [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) distinction which has been lost in almost all other Austronesian languages.",

[Proto-Puyuma](LanguageTable#cldf:19085) &ast;_kani_ ‘here’, [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) _anhi_ ‘here, in this place’,  may reflect &ast;_ka-ni_, a form that was identical to &ast;_ka-i-ni_, without the generic locative marker &ast;_i_, and &ast;_si-ni_ may derive form &ast;_sa_ ‘nonfocus marker of location’ plus &ast;_i-ni_.",

As such it signalled both possessors and non-subject agents.  This dual function was retained in most Philippine-type languages in Taiwan, the Philippines and northern Borneo, as well as in the Batak languages of northern Sumatra, and indirectly through the genitive suffix &ast;_-ña_ (< &ast;_ni-á_) in [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573), and in western Indonesian languages that have reduced the four-voice system of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) to a simple active-passive dichotomy, as in [Bintulu](LanguageTable#cldf:242) of Borneo, or [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326).  The agent-marking function of &ast;_ni_ evidently was lost in all CEMP languages, leaving it only as a genitive of general possession or part-to-whole relationships.

Whether the single-consonant suffix in such cases reflects [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_ni_ ‘genitive’ or &ast;_-ña_ ‘3sg possessor’ it’s ultimate origin must be traced to [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_ni_.",crowley2006[71]

Philippine forms such as [Itbayaten](LanguageTable#cldf:282) _sinoh_ and [Aklanon](LanguageTable#cldf:226) _sinʔuh_ suggest &ast;_-nuh_, but the final consonant is not supported by [Atayal](LanguageTable#cldf:493), [Saisiyat](LanguageTable#cldf:400) or other [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) languages.

 It is unclear whether this morpheme could occur in isolation in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072), since such reflexes as [Melanau Dalat (Kampung Kekan)](LanguageTable#cldf:576) _new_ ‘what?’ could be products of secondary reduction.  &ast;_-nuh_ was a formative in many interrogative words, but apparently was not an interrogative marker itself, as there is no comparative evidence that it could be used to transform declarative into interrogative expressions.

The search for a [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) term for ‘squid’ is frustrating, since there are many words with this meaning that show greater than chance phonetic similarity, but few that exhibit recurrent sound correspondences, a situation that obtains even within the Oceanic group ([Blust 1978:147](Source#cldf:blust1978), [Ross 1988:342, 344](Source#cldf:ross1988)).  [Pawley (2011)](Source#cldf:pawley2011) reconstructs [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_nusa_ (doublet &ast;_nus_) ‘small reef squid (_Loligo_ spp.) and smaller cuttlefish (_Sepia_ spp.)’.  While the longer of these doublets is clearly justified, it is the shorter one that appears a priori to have possible cognates outside the Oceanic group.  All of the forms cited in the above comparison can reflect &ast;_nues_, but it is not at all clear that such a [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) etymon existed.  Oceanic forms such as [Kairiru](LanguageTable#cldf:667) _nus_ ‘squid’, [Mbula](LanguageTable#cldf:815) _nus_ ‘squid type (smaller-sized), [Rotuman](LanguageTable#cldf:394) _nū_ ‘squid, small type of cuttlefish’ initially appear to be related, but the first of these is better accounted for by [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_nuso_ ‘smaller types of reef squid’, and the regular reflex of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_nues_ in [Rotuman](LanguageTable#cldf:394) would be &ast;&ast;__nuo__.  Forms in the Admiralty islands which appear to reflect an earlier monosyllable clearly indicate &ast;_ñ_ as the initial consonant, thus conflicting with the evidence of [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Acehnese](LanguageTable#cldf:225), [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285) and [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573), all of which point unambiguously to &ast;_n_,  Adding to the difficulty of Pawley’s (2011) [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_nus_ ‘squid’ is the extreme rarity (one might even say non-existence) of reconstructed content words at the [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) level or higher which are monosyllabic.  Finally, additional doublets could be reconstructed based on very slender evidence, as with [Pak](LanguageTable#cldf:371) _nuy_, [Gedaged](LanguageTable#cldf:269) _nui_, [Manam](LanguageTable#cldf:328) _nuri_ < &ast;_nuRi_, or [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) _núkus_, [Binukid](LanguageTable#cldf:19012) _nukus_, [Loniu](LanguageTable#cldf:321) _ñuk_ < &ast;_ñukus_, but as noted in [Blust (1978:147)](Source#cldf:blust1978) given the generally chaotic comparative picture presented by phonetically similar but non-corresponding forms beginning with a reflex of &ast;_nu-_, &ast;_ñu-_ or occasionally &ast;_ŋu-_, this temptation is best resisted.","blust1978[147];ross1988[342, 344];pawley2011;blust1978[147]"

30334,*Namat,N,iron (metal),"This is a critically important comparison that should be considered in conjunction with &ast;_diNaŋ_ ‘rust’.  According to [Tsuchida (1982)](Source#cldf:tsuchida1982) in May, 1917 the form _tamat_ was recorded by an unnamed Japanese colonial policeman from one of the last speakers of [Taokas](LanguageTable#cldf:19210), which soon after became extinct.  This material was then transferred to the pioneering Formosan linguist Naoyoshi Ogawa, where it remained in his notebooks until it was rediscovered in recent decades.  No other reflex of &ast;_Namat_ is known, and there are essentially two reasonable explanations for this distribution.  One is that the word is a loan from [Taokas](LanguageTable#cldf:19210) to [Kavalan](LanguageTable#cldf:293) or vice-versa (or perhaps from an intermediate language that has since lost it, such as the inadequately known Liulang).  Within modern times [Taokas](LanguageTable#cldf:19210) and [Kavalan](LanguageTable#cldf:293) have not been in contact, and they are separated by a considerable mountain massif now peopled by speakers of [Atayal](LanguageTable#cldf:493) However, there is some evidence that the Atayalic peoples have moved northward into their present territory within the past few centuries ([Blust 1996:283-288](Source#cldf:blust1996)), and it is thus possible that prior to the Atayal reaching their historically attested distribution the Taokas had a wider east-west territorial spread than they had when linguistic and ethnographic recording in this part of Taiwan began during the Japanese colonial period starting in 1895.  




The second explanation, of course, is that these terms are simply the last relics of a word that was used by the original Austronesian settlers of Taiwan in the period 5,500-6,000 BP.  Since known reflexes of &ast;_diNaŋ_ ‘rust’ are restricted to [Saisiyat](LanguageTable#cldf:400) and [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370), where borrowing is effectively not an issue, this second explanation for reflexes of &ast;_Namat_ seems clearly to be favored.  The issue of early Austronesian knowledge and possible use of iron has come up before in conjunction with a different set of comparisons ([Blust 1976, 1999](Source#cldf:blust1976)), with the strongest evidence pointing to a language ancestral to those in at least the Philippines and western Indonesia, but not Taiwan.  The evidence for &ast;_diNaŋ_ ‘rust’ and &ast;_Namat_ ‘iron’ pushes the inferences for knowledge of iron back to the earliest stages of reconstructed history in the Austronesian language family.  Given the predominant view among archaeologists and other scholars that use of the iron is a relatively late development in island Southeast Asia these linguistic comparisons are sure to come under fire.  However, both comparisons are firmly established, and they provide two independent lines of evidence leading to the same conclusion.  In discussing the material culture of the Formosan aborigines [Chen (1988:146)](Source#cldf:chen1988) rather matter-of-factly notes that “Spears are used by all tribes,” and he describes a wide variety of spears and harpoons, all of which have iron heads.  He also notes that arrowheads were commonly made of iron, but he provides no information of any kind on metallurgy in general, or the process of making iron points for spears or arrows in particular, and we are not told whether the earliest Chinese reports on the aborigines noted that they were using iron-tipped arrows and spears.  However, given the two independent pieces of linguistic evidence cited here it seems clear that anyone wishing to understand the culture history of the Austronesian-speaking peoples must give serious consideration to the possibility that iron was used on Taiwan for the manufacture of at least arrow and spear/harpoon heads from a far earlier time than is commonly accepted.  Whether this continued after the Austronesian migration to the Philippines and beyond is a distinct question. 



Finally, [Saisiyat](LanguageTable#cldf:400) _malat_ ‘knife’ may reflect this form with metathesis (&ast;_Namat_ > &ast;_maNat_), a possibility suggested to me in correspondence by David Zorc.",tsuchida1982;blust1996[283-288];blust1976;chen1988[146]

[Balinese](LanguageTable#cldf:235) _natah_ probably is a loan from [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285) that underwent subsequent sound change.  This leaves only [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) _natar_ as possibly pointing to &ast;_nataD_ rather than &ast;_natad_. 
The basic meaning of this term evidently was ‘cleared land in a village’ (as opposed to jungle/bush), with specific reference to the cleared area around a house, or the village square used as a meeting place.  From that basic sense it evolved in some languages into terms referring cleared agricultural land ([Tetun](LanguageTable#cldf:1060)), or baldness ([Kei](LanguageTable#cldf:298)).

This reconstruction is somewhat tentative, since the inclusion of [Saisiyat](LanguageTable#cldf:400) _ka-lhib_ depends on a morpheme division of somewhat dubious status, and without the [Saisiyat](LanguageTable#cldf:400) form the word is attested only in languages that are geographically contiguous, hence raising the prospect of borrowing, a possibility that is strengthened by the apparent borrowing of a dialectal [Amis](LanguageTable#cldf:227) form into [Kavalan](LanguageTable#cldf:293).  In favor of maintaining the comparison, on the other hand, are the observation that medial consonant clusters in [Saisiyat](LanguageTable#cldf:400) always reflect earlier sequences in which an intervening vowel has dropped, and the appearance of an unexplained _ka-_ on a number of other nouns, as [Saisiyat (Taai)](LanguageTable#cldf:977) _ka-kliw_ (< &ast;_keRiw_) ‘hemp’, _kæ-ʔLor_ ‘pillar’ (< &ast;_qelud_ ‘main house post’, _ka-sbol_ (< &ast;_CebuN_) ‘smoke’, and _ka-tboʃ_ (< &ast;_tebuS_) ‘sugarcane’.  


Given the specific agreements between [Saisiyat](LanguageTable#cldf:400) and [Paiwan (Western)](LanguageTable#cldf:18972) the meaning seems clearly to have been ‘rock shelter, cave under an overhanging rock’ rather than simply ‘cave’.  We can only wonder why such a feature of the natural landscape was deemed sufficiently important to be lexically encoded in a unique way, but it is possible that such natural shelters were frequently used by the indigenous population of hunter-gatherers (bearers of the palaeolithic Ch’angpinian archaeological culture) who were encountered by Austronesian-speakers when they arrived in Taiwan, and who disappeared from the island within centuries of that event.",liandtsuchida2006[143]

With root [&ast;-pis₂](cf.csv#cldf:Root-30053) ‘thin, tenuous; fine’.  Although this term evidently referred to the thinness of flat objects in general, it is associated particularly often in sentence examples of the primary sources with woven cloth, and it appears likely that it was applied with very high frequency to describing fabric that was thinner than usual.



[Tsuchida (1976)](Source#cldf:tsuchida1976) reconstructed [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_Nix₁əpis_ ‘thin’, adding a syllable to account for the preconsonantal aspirate of [Saisiyat](LanguageTable#cldf:400) _lihpih-an_ ‘thin (as paper)’.  However, numerous other words for this meaning contain a reflex of [&ast;-pis₂](cf.csv#cldf:Root-30053), as [Pazeh](LanguageTable#cldf:375) _halipit_ ‘thin’, [Amis (Kiwit)](LanguageTable#cldf:19260) _kuhpits_ ‘thin’, [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) _ɬusepit_ ‘be thin (as paper)’, [Kavalan](LanguageTable#cldf:293) _inpis_ ~ _impis_ ‘thin (like paper)’, [Yami](LanguageTable#cldf:1131) _ma-taripis_ ‘thin (as a board)’, [Isneg](LanguageTable#cldf:647) _iŋpít_ ‘thin, tenuous (paper, plates, strings, etc.)’, as well as others that mimic the same root, as with [Bunun](LanguageTable#cldf:250) _ma-nisbis_ ‘thin’ ([Ferrell 1969](Source#cldf:ferrell1969)), or [Puyuma (Tamalakaw)](LanguageTable#cldf:18964) _a-RipiT_ ‘thin, as a board or the arm’.

If it shares the same history then &ast;_Ri-hinawa_ must be posited for [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:19083), raising questions about the absence of &ast;_Ri-_ in other non-Greater Central Philippine languages.  For this reason I tentatively assume that the _li-_ of [Pangasinan](LanguageTable#cldf:920) _li-náwa_ is unrelated to the _gi-_ of Central Philippine forms such as [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _gi-nháwa_.



It would be easy to reconstruct [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_ñawa_ and ignore the Philippine and Sulawesian forms that point to an original trisyllable, but the highly distinctive semantic agreement of [Itbayaten](LanguageTable#cldf:282) _hinawa_ ‘breath, respiration’, or [Tombonuwo](LanguageTable#cldf:19188) _inawo_ ‘soul’ with disyllables such as [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _ñawa_ ‘life in its association with the breath; soul’ strongly suggests that we are dealing with a single cognate set.  Since most AN languages reflect a form in which &ast;_i_ must have followed &ast;_n_ rather than preceding it I reconstruct &ast;_nihawa_, a trisyllable that is supported by [Yakan](LanguageTable#cldf:1129) _niyawa_, [Sangir](LanguageTable#cldf:402) _niawa_, and many languages that appear to reflect an original &ast;_ñawa_. Unless we posit doublets &ast;_nihawa_, &ast;_hinawa_ this unavoidably implies an independent metathesis in e.g. [Itbayaten](LanguageTable#cldf:282) _hinawa_, [Tombonuwo](LanguageTable#cldf:19188) _inawo_, [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947) _inaa_, [Muna](LanguageTable#cldf:350) _inawa_, and what appears to be a secondary metathesis in Greater Central Philippine forms such as [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _gi-nháwa_ (with syncopated &ast;_i_ in the environment VC__CV).  



The reconstruction proposed here differs from that of [Tsuchida (1976:229)](Source#cldf:tsuchida1976), who posited [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) _&ast;ñiSawa_ with an initial palatal nasal, but also reconstructed &ast;_N-_ in other forms.  However, there are problems with this proposal.  First, very little evidence has been found to support the claim that [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_N_ and &ast;_ñ_ were distinct phonemes.  Second, the sound correspondences between [Kanakanabu](LanguageTable#cldf:680) and [Saaroa](LanguageTable#cldf:974) that Tsuchida took to support &ast;_ñ_ are violated by [Saaroa](LanguageTable#cldf:974) in this case (in showing /_n_/ rather than /_ɬ_/).  Third, most instances of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_N_ clearly became [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_n_, and given a [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) palatal nasal we would expect the [Kapampangan](LanguageTable#cldf:291) form to be &ast;&ast;__-iñawa__, not _–inawa_ (note that the [Wolio](LanguageTable#cldf:1124) variant _iñawa_ is also irregular, and is best seen as a sporadic palatalization of n by the preceding high vowel).



Reflexes of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) _&ast;nihawa_ are particularly interesting in providing one of the rare examples of a phonemic palatal nasal arising from a sequence of &ast;_n_ + _ia_, much like [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072)/[PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_ni-á_ ‘3sg. genitive’ > [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_-ña_ ‘3sg possessor’.  What is unknown is how many parallel innovations of the form _&ast;nihawa_ > _niawa_ > _ñawa_ must be assumed in order to account for the data in terms that are compatible with currently accepted subgrouping hypotheses.  It is clear, for example, that the reanalysis of &ast;_nihawa_ to &ast;_-ñawa_ was already complete in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_mañawa_, parallel to the reanalysis of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_ni-á_ to [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_-ña_ ‘3sg possessor’, but languages such as [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) evidently developed a palatal nasal in this form through an independent change that followed the same evolutionary path.



Finally, the semantics of &ast;_nihawa_ provide a reminder of the universality of animism, as first clearly stated by [Tylor (1871)](bib-Tylor): from the notion ‘breath; to breathe’ there is a link to the ‘breath soul’, and from this to ‘soul; inner self, mind, feelings’, but in another direction to ‘breathe easily, take a break, rest’.  Although it may initially appear to be adventitious, the recurrent reference to the fontanel links to the widespread traditional belief that the soul exits the body in dreams or death through the fontanel/top of the head (also clearly linked to the pulsation of breathing in an infant’s still-forming skull).",tsuchida1976[229]

Some writers, as [English (1986)](Source#cldf:english1986) treat this as a borrowing of Spanish _palo_ ‘stick, cudgel’, but cognates outside the Philippines, and the occasional use of this word as a verb meaning ‘hit with the fists’ suggest that the similarity between Spanish _palo_ and forms in Philippine languages is due to chance.  [Dempwolff (1938)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) also included [Fijian](LanguageTable#cldf:266) _valu_ ‘to make war on, be at war with’, but the connection of this form to the others cited here is more doubtful.  The other question that arises in connection with this comparison is why [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276) and several Central Philippine languages reflect a final glottal stop.  Initially this appears to support the proposal of [Zorc (1996)](Source#cldf:zorc1996) that [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) and various of its descendant proto-languages had a glottal stop distinct from &ast;_q_.  However, it is clear that word-final glottal stop is often historically secondary in [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276), and it therefore seems best to treat [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276) _paluʔ_ as equivalent to _palu_.",english1986;dempwolff193438;zorc1996

[Label](LanguageTable#cldf:309) _han_ is assumed to reflect [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_pana_ rather than &ast;_pano_ since its closest relatives which have preserved the final vowel point to &ast;_-a_.",
27285,*panahik,p,climb,"Also [Samoan](LanguageTable#cldf:401) _fānaʔe_ ‘(of moon and tide) rise’.  [Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) reconstructed &ast;_nahik_ ‘climb, ascend’, but the evidence for his reconstruction is far less persuasive than the evidence for &ast;_panahik_.  Apart from the Javanese form cited here, Dempwolff compared [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) _naik_ ‘rise, climb (as the price of something), increase’, [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _naik_ ‘motion up.  Of mounting or rising, either literally or figuratively’, and [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) _naek_, _naik_ ‘ascend, climb, rise in esteem’.  The [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) form could be a back-formation from &ast;&ast;_memenaik-i_ (reduced to attested _menaik-i_ by haplology, then interpreted as deriving from a prefixed base _naik_).  


Both the [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) and [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) words, as well as [Bimanese](LanguageTable#cldf:241) _neʔe_ ‘climb’ appear to be [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) loans, and so do not constitute independent evidence for the disyllable.  More serious as evidence for &ast;_nahik_ are [Isneg](LanguageTable#cldf:647) _uneʔ_ ‘enter a house, mount the ladder, climb a tree’, [Casiguran Dumagat](LanguageTable#cldf:569) _unek_ ‘climb up a tree’.  However, these and similar forms in other languages of northern Luzon contain an unexplained initial syllable that would have to reflect &ast;_u-_.  [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245) _onik_ ‘go upward!’, _mo-onik_ ‘high’, _monik_ ‘upwards; sometimes: northwards’ points to &ast;_anahik_ rather than &ast;_unahik_, while [Bare'e](LanguageTable#cldf:236) _nae_ ‘rise slightly (as a trail)’, _ma-nai_ ‘rise, esp. of water in larger rivers (Poso, Puna) and the sea’ probably is a chance resemblance (cf. [Bare'e](LanguageTable#cldf:236) _pone_ for the true cognate).  Finally, if Dempwolff's &ast;_nahik_ is accepted it is difficult on both formal and semantic grounds to establish a regular morphological relationship between it and &ast;_panahik_.",dempwolff193438

Despite widespread reflexes in this meaning, [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_panaq_ almost certainly did not mean ‘bow’, since this can be reconstructed confidently as &ast;_busuR_.  Instead, &ast;_panaq_ was a verb meaning something like ‘shoot at a target, try to hit with a projectile.’  In many daughter languages it became a noun, enough so that languages such as [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) and [Kambera](LanguageTable#cldf:678) use the terms ‘mother of shooting’ for ‘bow’ and ‘child of shooting’ for ‘arrow’.  Whether these complex expressions already existed in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081), or are products of convergence remains unclear.  The actor voice of this verb was formed with &ast;_-um-_ in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072), but apparently this construction was replaced in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) by prefixation with &ast;_maŋ-_.",

This widely distributed term was replaced by &ast;_mpekʷa_ in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082), and by a variety of terms in Borneo, Sumatra, Java, Bali, and Lombok.  In some languages of the Lesser Sundas, reflexes of &ast;_paniki_ refer both to the large tree-roosting fruit bat (_Pteropus_ sp.) and to the smaller insectivorous cave bats.  These two are lexically distinguished in so many languages that an original distinction seems likely, but no good reconstruction is yet available for the latter.

This interpretation appears to be supported by the probably independent development of the metaphorical sense ‘die; death’ in [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279), [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423), and [Samoan](LanguageTable#cldf:401).  The generalization of this meaning to ‘go, walk’ (or its similar misconstrual by the compilers of some dictionaries) is readily comprehensible. 


[PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) &ast;_panaw_ may have taken the infix &ast;_-um-_, but the available evidence is indeterminate: [Isneg](LanguageTable#cldf:647) _p-um-ánaw_ ‘go away, depart, withdraw’, [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) _p-um-ánaw_ ‘go away, leave, quit, depart’, [Bisaya (Limbang)](LanguageTable#cldf:542) _manaw_ ‘go, walk’ (from &ast;_p-um-anaw_ with loss of the first syllable, or from &ast;_panaw_ with homorganic nasal substitution?).  Similarly, [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) may have had both &ast;_pano_ ‘depart’ and &ast;_pano-ŋa_ ‘journey’: [Mota](LanguageTable#cldf:344) _vano-ŋa_ ‘journey; coming, going’, [Niue](LanguageTable#cldf:362) _fano-ŋa_ ‘journey; company of travellers’, possibly [Bugotu](LanguageTable#cldf:248) _vano-ña_ ‘a journey, a going’ (if Ivens’ _vano-gna_ is a typographical error for _vano-ŋa_).  The agreement of reduplication in [Rejang](LanguageTable#cldf:389) _paneuw-paneuw_ ‘go for a walk’ and such [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) forms as [Tuvaluan](LanguageTable#cldf:19417) _fano-fano_ ‘until’, [Rennellese](LanguageTable#cldf:390) _hano-hano_ ‘genealogy’, on the other hand, is almost certainly due to chance.

The sporadic loss of the medial vowel everywhere outside Taiwan can be taken as one small piece of evidence for the [MP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) subgroup.  Irregular reflexes are so common throughout Sulawesi that they can be taken to support a variant &ast;_pondan_ (with borrowing into some languages).  Similarly, reflexes with first-syllable shwa are pervasive in the Lesser Sundas, and suggest a [PCMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076) variant &ast;_pendan_.  Although the _P. odoratissimus_ and _P. tectorius_ are the species most commonly noted in dictionary glosses, the term &ast;_paŋudaN_ evidently referred to all _Pandanaceae_.  Varieties of this economically important plant were widely used in the plaiting of mats and baskets.  As noted by [Mills (1975:793)](Source#cldf:mills1975), the frequent lexical equation between the native pandanus and the introduced (South American) pineapple may be due to similarities in the thorny leaves (cf. also [Sika](LanguageTable#cldf:414) _pedaŋ_ ‘cactus’).  As a basis for this equation one could, however, point equally to the clustered (and edible) pandanus fruits, which collectively resemble the shape and external texture of the pineapple.",dempwolff193438;mills1975[793]

[Pazeh](LanguageTable#cldf:375) _pazit_ can reflect &ast;_pasis_ or &ast;_pasit_, [Bunun](LanguageTable#cldf:250) forms reflect an etymon with medial glottal stop rather than &ast;_q_, and as noted by [Tsuchida (1976:259)](Source#cldf:tsuchida1976), the vocalism of the [Tsou](LanguageTable#cldf:1087) form is unexpected, suggesting possible borrowing from [Bunun](LanguageTable#cldf:250). 



Although reflexes of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_paqit_ are most commonly glossed ‘bitter’, various glosses suggest that the meaning of this term did not correspond precisely to any English word, as seen in the recurrent references to the taste of fermented drinks ([Kanakanabu](LanguageTable#cldf:680), [Ifugaw (Batad)](LanguageTable#cldf:18225), [Ibaloy](LanguageTable#cldf:19182), [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947)), to the acrid sensation of smoke entering the nostrils ([Ifugaw (Batad)](LanguageTable#cldf:18225)), and various references to the taste of salt or saltwater ([Ifugaw (Batad)](LanguageTable#cldf:18225), [Ibaloy](LanguageTable#cldf:19182), [Tboli](LanguageTable#cldf:19175), [Yakan](LanguageTable#cldf:1129), [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432), [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660), [Kambera](LanguageTable#cldf:678)).  Taken as a whole this range of meanings suggests that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_paqit_ referred to a strong, somewhat objectionable taste in food.  Given the semantic agreement of [Saisiyat](LanguageTable#cldf:400) _pæʔis_ ‘hot (taste)’ with [Itawis](LanguageTable#cldf:648) _pet_ ‘hotness, pungency, spiciness’ a similar meaning appears to be supported for [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072), but the various phonologically irregular forms in Formosan languages suggest that ‘bitterness’ should not be excluded from the gloss.",dyen1965;tsuchida1976[259]

First, if [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _perahu_ is a borrowing of _padao_ or _parao_ there is no explanation for its medial _-h-_, nor for the corresponding segment in the [Sundanese](LanguageTable#cldf:418) and [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660) cognates.

Second, apparent cognates of [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _perahu_ are found not only in island Southeast Asia, but also in western Melanesia, a situation that is virtually unknown for established loan distributions.  Finally, because it is also necessary to reconstruct &ast;_padaw_ ‘kind of sailboat’ (q.v.), many Philippine forms are difficult to classify.  [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _paráw_ ‘large passenger and cargo sailboat’ must reflect &ast;_padaw_, and [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) _paráw_ (if not a Tagalog loan) must reflect &ast;_paraqu_, but similar forms in other languages, as [Bikol](LanguageTable#cldf:244) _paráw_ ‘boat’ or [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) _parao_ ‘dhow’ are ambiguous for &ast;_paraqu_ or &ast;_padaw_.

[Dempwolff (1920)](Source#cldf:dempwolff1920) posited [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_baRi-_ ‘Sozialprafix’.  His supporting evidence from non-[Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) languages consisted of the [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) prefix _ber-_ and putative fossilized affixes in [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) (_bor-_), [Sundanese](LanguageTable#cldf:418)(_bar-_), [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577)(/bar-/), and [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325)(/ba-/).  [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _ber-_, however, evidently derives from &ast;_maR-_ ([Teeuw 1965](Source#cldf:teeuw1965)), and the reality of the ""fossilized affixes"" in the other languages is open to question.  Despite these problems a number of [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) languages clearly reflect &ast;_paRi-_, and [Buli](LanguageTable#cldf:249) _fa-_, _fai-_ evidently is cognate with these forms, thus indicating Proto-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian &ast;_paRi-_.  


The following additional observations are noteworthy:",dempwolff1920;teeuw1965
27334,*paRigi,p,"artificially enclosed catchment for water: well, ditch","Also [Tiruray](LanguageTable#cldf:433) _faligiʔ_ ‘a well for water’, [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245) _parigiʔ_ ‘well for water’, [Buruese](LanguageTable#cldf:251) _parigi_ ‘well’, all of which appear to be [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) loans, and [Balinese](LanguageTable#cldf:235) _parigi_ ‘stone steps, stairway’, which may be a loan from [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660).  The essence of this comparison was first noted in print by [Sneddon (1984)](Source#cldf:sneddon1984). [Zoetmulder (1982)](Source#cldf:zoetmulder1982) suggests that [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660) _parigi_ may be a Tamil loan, but the wider distribution documented here makes this unlikely.",sneddon1984;zoetmulder1982
27337,*paRiS,p,stingray,"Also [Bare'e](LanguageTable#cldf:236) _pagi_ ‘file, consisting of a block of wood wrapped in stingray skin’, [Wolio](LanguageTable#cldf:1124) _pagi_ ‘ray (fish); file, grater, rasp’, [Manggarai](LanguageTable#cldf:816), [Kambera](LanguageTable#cldf:678) _pai_ ‘stingray’, all of which may be loans, though source languages are difficult to find for at least the first three words.  This fish was valued for its rough skin, which was used like sandpaper.  

[PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_paRih_ evidently described all skates and rays, and also referred to a constellation which was conceived as resembling a skate or ray.  Three [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076) languages which are either closely related or geographically contiguous agree in indicating Scorpio as the constellation in question, while [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _bintaŋ pari_, [Maori](LanguageTable#cldf:330) _te whai a titipa_ both refer to the Southern Cross or to some feature that is visually near it. The reference to a string figure used in Cat's-cradle in Fiji and parts of Polynesia may derive historically from the constellation.  


Finally, reflexes of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_paRih manuk_ vividly illustrate the value of loanwords in reconstruction.  In a number of languages the larger manta or eagle rays are lexically identified with eagles or bats: [Loniu](LanguageTable#cldf:321) _menuay_, [Ahus](LanguageTable#cldf:466) _menwa_, [Pak](LanguageTable#cldf:371), [Leipon](LanguageTable#cldf:730) _menwey_ ‘sea eagle; spotted eagle ray’, [Wuvulu](LanguageTable#cldf:445), [Aua](LanguageTable#cldf:234) _manua_ ‘sea eagle’, [Gapapaiwa](LanguageTable#cldf:609) _manu-manua_ ‘small (=large?) sting ray’, [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573) _fanihen tasi_ (lit. ‘bat of the sea’) ‘manta ray, sting ray, leopard ray’.  Reflexes such as [Kwaio](LanguageTable#cldf:307) _fali-manu_, [Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434) _fai-manu_ thus apparently derive from [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_paRi manuk_ ‘manta ray, spotted eagle ray’ (lit. ‘bird ray’).  This inference is confirmed by a single known non-[Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) reflex, which is clearly a loan: [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _pali-manók_.  Given the larger pattern of known borrowing in [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423), one would naturally suspect [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) as the source of this term, but _pari manok_ apparently does not occur in [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326). Despite the difficulty of identifying a source, however, [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _palimanók_ must derive from a [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) language and the inference to [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_paRih manuk_ is inescapable.",

[PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_penuq_ evidently referred to fullness and filling of containers with liquid or solid material; however, in many of the reflexes is also used in a somewhat more abstract sense, as with people filling a room or graves filling a village.

Since [Kavalan](LanguageTable#cldf:293) _pənu_ is the sole known Formosan reflex of this word, and since in [Kavalan](LanguageTable#cldf:293) _pənu_ refers to all marine turtles without distinction, it is unclear whether there was a more specific referent of &ast;_peñu_ in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072).

However, modern dictionaries do not give [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _piak_, the [Hiligaynon](LanguageTable#cldf:623) and [Aklanon](LanguageTable#cldf:226) forms cited here conflict with &ast;_piqak_, and the [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432) form is irregular in showing _p-_ rather than _f-_.  [Richards (1981)](Source#cldf:richards1981) cites [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276) _piak_, and [Wilkinson (1959:901)](Source#cldf:wilkinson1959) cites [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _pihak_ as a borrowing of Arabic _fihak_ ‘side’, but this is surely wrong, given its presence both in [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660), which preceded sustained Arabic influence, and in languages of the central Philippine which are unlikely to have borrowed it.  Nonetheless [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _pihak_ and [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660) _pihak-an_ are regular only under a derivation from &ast;_piqak_, leaving several unanswered questions about this comparison.",dempwolff193438;dyen1953[10];richards1981;wilkinson1959[901]
30605,*pijax,p,"interrogative of quantity: how much?, how many?; adjective of indefinite quantity: some, several, a few","Also [Bunun](LanguageTable#cldf:250) _piaq_ ‘how many?’, [Itbayaten](LanguageTable#cldf:282) _pirah_ how many?, _pa-pirah_ ‘how many (in units or number, not in time)’, [Ilongot](LanguageTable#cldf:642) _pigi_ ‘how many?’, [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _ilán_ ‘how many?; a few; more than two or three, but not many; several; some’, [Agutaynen](LanguageTable#cldf:19189) _pirapa_ ‘amount; how much?, how many?’, [Tiruray](LanguageTable#cldf:433) _firoy_ ‘how much?, how many?, [Enggano](LanguageTable#cldf:596) _ʔa-píaha_ ‘how much?, how many?’, [Kilivila](LanguageTable#cldf:19026) _vila_ ‘how many?’, [Sa’a](LanguageTable#cldf:18945) _(e)-nite_, [Ulawa](LanguageTable#cldf:1095) _(e)-nita_ ‘how many?, so many; a few’, [Rotuman](LanguageTable#cldf:394) _hisi_ ‘how many?  


Used indefinitely (several, I don’t know how many), as well as interrogatively’.  The endings in several of these irregular forms are puzzling.  While [Bunun](LanguageTable#cldf:250) _–q_ is at odds with all other languages that retain final consonants, [Itbayaten](LanguageTable#cldf:282) _–h_, which could reflect [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_S_ or &ast;_h_, presents more subtle problems.  If it reflected &ast;_S_ we would expect a final sibilant in all six of the Formosan witnesses cited here, and this alternative is therefore strongly disfavored.  However, if [Itbayaten](LanguageTable#cldf:282) _pirah_ reflects &ast;_pijah_ the only witness that can be cited as a check is [Amis](LanguageTable#cldf:227).  Nonetheless, since [Amis](LanguageTable#cldf:227) _pina_ contradicts the reconstruction of &ast;_-h_, it seems best to posit [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_pija_, and assume that both [Bunun](LanguageTable#cldf:250) _piaq_ and [Itbayaten](LanguageTable#cldf:282) _pirah_ have added a final consonant through some unknown historically secondary process.  [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _ilán_ for expected &ast;&ast;_pilá_, on the other hand, is doubly irregular in showing loss of &ast;_p-_ and addition of _–n_, but the highly specific semantics make it very likely that this form is also a reflex of &ast;_pija_. 


This form is well-know as an interrogative of quantity, in which sense it has been reconstructed by [Dempwolff (1938)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438), and [Wolff (2010:933)](Source#cldf:wolff2010).  However, cognates distributed from [Atayal](LanguageTable#cldf:493) to [Maori](LanguageTable#cldf:330) show clearly that it also functioned as an adjective of indefinite quantity, translatable into English as ‘some, several, a few’.",dempwolff193438;wolff2010[933]

This term clearly referred to the action of making a choice or selection from a range of alternatives.  However, two more specific senses stand out from the glosses recorded for several languages.  First is the meaning  ‘pick out undesirable inclusions (pebbles, bad grains, etc.) from rice after the pounding and before or during cooking’ ([Pazeh](LanguageTable#cldf:375),[Itbayaten](LanguageTable#cldf:282), [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279), [Aklanon](LanguageTable#cldf:226), [Tausug](LanguageTable#cldf:18831), perhaps [Muna](LanguageTable#cldf:350)).  Second is the meaning ‘what is left over after the best has been picked out’ ([Aklanon](LanguageTable#cldf:226), [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314), [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947), [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325)).  Even though the forms that have this meaning generally differ in their overall word shape (taking different affixes), the recurrent association of these two senses of ‘choosing’ with the base &ast;_piliq_ makes it very likely that they were part of the original signification of the term, a signification that can clearly be connected with [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:19083) _&ast;piliq-an_ ‘pick out impurities from husked rice, prior to cooking’.

However, monosyllabic content morphemes are almost unknown in any early Austronesian proto-language, and it is difficult to extract a straightforward comparison from his data. [Samoan](LanguageTable#cldf:401) _fō-maɁi_  is phonologically irregular, and morphological data from the language shows that fō cannot be glossed ‘lord’.  The first element of [Fijian](LanguageTable#cldf:266) _vū-ni-wai_ almost certainly reflects [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_puqun_ ‘base of a tree; cause; source; origin’, and the [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) and [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) words require morphological analyses that are not independently motivated. While Dempwolff’s comparison hardly stands close scrutiny, then, the one offered here is far more consistent with the comparative method, and leads to a disyllabic content morpheme, which avoids the canonical contradiction posed by &ast;_pu_.

The [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432), [Buginese](LanguageTable#cldf:239) and [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325) forms agree in indicating a variant &ast;_unti_, but until further evidence is forthcoming these will be taken as convergent irregularities.  




Probably the most controversial feature of this reconstruction is its level, which must be considered questionable for two reasons.  First, [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_beNbeN_ ‘banana’ can be justified on the basis of Formosan evidence.  Second, evidence for the [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) (as opposed to [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081)) status of &ast;_punti_ depends critically on the form _puti_ in two dialects of the same language (Ketagalan), which was spoken in extreme northeast Taiwan until the late 19th or early 20th century.  The Spanish occupied this area from 1626-1642, and left some clear loanwords in [Kavalan](LanguageTable#cldf:293), spoken just to the south of Ketagalan.  Since the Spanish in Taiwan came from Manila rather than from Spain it is likely that they brought some Filipinos with them, most likely speakers of [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423).  It is thus tempting to consider the [Basai](LanguageTable#cldf:19171) and [Trobiawan](LanguageTable#cldf:19209) words as loans from a Philippine language.  The problem with this hypothesis is that very few Philippine languages have a reflex of &ast;_punti_, and all known cases are found on Palawan or in the Calamian Islands, areas from which Filipinos were not likely to have been taken by the colonial Spanish.  We are left, then, with abundant evidence for [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_punti_, but very tenuous evidence for a [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) reconstruction of this shape.  If the [Basai](LanguageTable#cldf:19171) and [Trobiawan](LanguageTable#cldf:19209) forms are native rather than borrowed it would appear that [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) distinguished two types of bananas.  If, instead, they are loans from the Philippines we must conclude either than some Filipinos from the Palawan region accompanied the 17th century Spanish colonizers of northern Taiwan, or that a reflex of &ast;_punti_ was still found in [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) or neighboring languages some 400 years ago, but has since been replaced by _ságiŋ_.  Since &ast;_sagiŋ_ must be posited for Proto-Central Philippines the latter possibility seems unlikely to find strong support.  Tentatively, then, both &ast;_beNbeN_ and &ast;_punti_ are posited for [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072).",

However, the comparative evidence does not support this interpretation at all.  First, the meaning ‘head’ in association with  [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _púnoʔ_ is found only in a figurative sense, never a literal sense.  [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _púnoʔ_ and similar forms in other Central  Philippine  languages clearly reflect [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_puqun_ ‘base of a tree, foundation; beginning, source, origin’, a meaning that is applied to high-status social roles in several parts of the  Austronesian  world (e.g. the mother’s brother in both northern Sumatra and much of the Lesser Sundas where matrilateral cross cousin marriage is the culturally favored norm, founder of a longhouse among the  Iban, spiritual leader among the Badui sect of  [Sundanese](LanguageTable#cldf:418)  speakers in west Java).

Finally, the medial glottal stop in [Lindrou](LanguageTable#cldf:739) and [Levei](LanguageTable#cldf:735) cannot be explained as a regular phonological development, and so points to an original trisyllable.",lichtenberk1998;rosspawleyandosmond2008[394-395];rosspawleyandosmond2008[395];ivens1940
29870,*puqun,p,"base of a tree; cause; source, origin; beginning; foot of a hill or mountain; first wife; model or example (to be copied); expression for the mother’s brother","Also [Ifugaw (Batad)](LanguageTable#cldf:18225) _pūu_ ‘the trunk base of a tree; the stalk of a hard-stalked plant; the bottom edge of a bat net; the basic premise upon which an argument, belief system or plan is based; the founders or most important leader of a social group’, with unexplained loss of the final consonant, [Simalur](LanguageTable#cldf:415) _xun_ ‘beginning; base of a tree, the thick ends of branches’, for expected &ast;&ast;un.  [Casiguran Dumagat](LanguageTable#cldf:569) _púnu_ ‘head, chief, leader’ and [Pangasinan](LanguageTable#cldf:920) _púno_ ‘head of a social group’ are assumed to be [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) loans.  



[PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_puqun_ is a key term in expressing a variety of both physical and social notions.  Physically it refers most directly to the base of a tree, that is, the part that emerges from the earth.  From this notion of emergence are derived the meanings ‘beginning’, ‘origin’, ‘foundation’, and more abstractly, ‘cause’ and ‘reason’.  Somewhat surprisingly, either alone or with affixation this base is also used in a number of languages to express the idea of ‘capital, starting funds’ in business.  The antiquity of this meaning cannot be great if capital is reckoned solely in terms of a money economy, but if this sense is historically secondary it has arisen in a surprisingly large number of apparently independent cases.  Most importantly for an understanding of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) social organization, reflexes of &ast;_puqun_ in both northern Sumatra ([Gayō](LanguageTable#cldf:610), Northern Batak) and in a number of societies of the Lesser Sundas ([Fox 1980:14](Source#cldf:fox1980)) refer to the mother’s brother as the source or beginning of life for his sister’s son, or more properly for the wife-taking descent group to which he belongs, and whose material and spiritual interests he supports through following the prescribed marriage rule of matrilateral cousin marriage.



In addition, affixed or compound reflexes of &ast;_puqun_ figure in expressing several [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) meanings that might otherwise go unnoticed in broad comparative work.  These include ‘horizon’ (lit. ‘beginning or foundation of the sky’, apparently applied most commonly to horizons on the sea), and ‘stranger, foreigner’ (the latter probably originally ‘person from the horizon’).



Although present evidence allows us to assign &ast;_puqun_ only to [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081), an unrelated base with much the same semantic range is seen in [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) _qapulu_ ‘trunk, stem; place of origin (figurative); capital (money); founder, earliest ancestor.’  Similarly, although reflexes of &ast;_puqun_ apparently were lost in [Proto-Polynesian](LanguageTable#cldf:19084), the concept was retained and associated with Proto-Eastern Polynesian &ast;_tumu_, with much the same semantic range, as seen [Rarotongan](LanguageTable#cldf:388) _tumu_ ‘foundation; root; cause; origin, source, that which introduces; the reason or cause of anything; the trunk or main part of anything from which something springs or is made, created, or fashioned;  _tumu rakau_ ‘trunk of a tree’,  _tumu enua_ ‘the original land; the head or chief of the land, the leaders or people of note of the land, the nobility or aristocracy;  _tumu karakia_ ‘the chief priest of the ancient house of learning who taught all that pertained to the office of the priests, and tribal lore, etc.; to lead off in chanting or reciting;  _tumu mauŋa_ ‘foundation or base of a mountain’;  _tumu raŋi_ ‘clouds’, [Maori](LanguageTable#cldf:330) _tumu_ ‘foundation’, [Hawaiian](LanguageTable#cldf:620) _kumu_ ‘bottom, base, foundation, basis, main stalk of a tree, trunk, handle, root (in arithmetic); basic, hereditary; teacher, manual, primer, model, pattern; beginning, source, origin; reason, cause;  _kumu pali_ ‘base, foot of a cliff’;  _aliʔi kumu_ ‘hereditary chief’.",fox1980[14]

In addition to its basic sense of ‘navel; mid-point or center of a place’ varying expressions that cannot yet be reconstructed with [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_pusej_ evidently also functioned to indicate: 1. the center of the earth ([Simalur](LanguageTable#cldf:415), [Sundanese](LanguageTable#cldf:418), [Ngadha](LanguageTable#cldf:357)), 2. the center or deepest part of the sea ([Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423), [Waray-Waray](LanguageTable#cldf:19275), [Tboli](LanguageTable#cldf:19175), [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Bare'e](LanguageTable#cldf:236)), 3. the apex of a casting net ([Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Mentawai](LanguageTable#cldf:335), [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660), [Sika](LanguageTable#cldf:414)), 4. consanguineal kin ([Nias](LanguageTable#cldf:361), [Tontemboan](LanguageTable#cldf:19052), [Bare'e](LanguageTable#cldf:236), [Ngadha](LanguageTable#cldf:357)), and 5. a weaving pattern in basketry or with rattan (see &ast;p<in>usej).  Some of these inferences are further strengthened by reflexes of the doublet [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_bito_, as seen in [Hawaiian](LanguageTable#cldf:620) _piko_ ‘fig. blood relative; design in plaiting the hat called _pāpale_ ‘_ie_; bottom round of a carrying net’.



As noted by [Ross (1988:43-45)](Source#cldf:ross1988) with regard to terms for ‘navel’ in Oceanic languages, there is a striking abundance of variants that are partially similar in form, but that do not exhibit recurrent sound correspondences.

Although a similar plethora of non-corresponding but similar forms is found in Formosan languages ([Ferrell 1969:229](Source#cldf:ferrell1969)), regular reflexes of &ast;_pusej_ are widespread throughout the Philippines and western Indonesia and not in competition with variants, the comparative picture worsening (again) for unknown reasons only as one moves into eastern Indonesia and the Pacific.",ross1988[43-45];ferrell1969[229]

In addition to meaning ‘shoulder’, unaffixed reflexes of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_qabaRa_ mean ‘to carry on the shoulder’ in various [CEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19074)  languages, and in [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573).  Although one would normally expect the body part term to be semantically primary and the verb derived, [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_qabaRa-an_ (‘place of shoulder-carrying’) suggests that &ast;_qabaRa_ originally meant ‘carry on the shoulder’.  Some [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) and [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) languages irregularly reflect this form without the initial syllable ([Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) _waga_, [Tiruray](LanguageTable#cldf:433) _wara_, [Mono-Alu](LanguageTable#cldf:19034) _fala_, [Nggela](LanguageTable#cldf:359) _vala_, etc.).  This may indicate that &ast;_qabaRa_ contains a prefix &ast;_qa-_ seen also in &ast;_qa-lima_ ‘hand’ and perhaps &ast;_qa-qaqi_ ‘foot’ (although tentatively I have reconstructed the latter as &ast;_qaqay_).

It referred to ashes, and prototypically to the ashes in the fireplace (hence its recurrent replacement of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_dapuR_ in the meaning ‘hearth’).  [Dyen (1953:29)](Source#cldf:dyen1953) erred doubly in positing &ast;_abuh_, the erroneous initial following from his acceptance of Dempwolff's use of [Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434) _efu_ ‘ash’ (actually a reflex of &ast;_dapuR_), and the erroneous final from his overconfidence in the evidentiary value of thematic -/_h_/ in the Tagalic languages. 


 Apart from the meanings given here it is likely that some form of &ast;_qabu_ was used to designate a type of plumage for domestic fowls in [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:19083) (cf. [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) _ábo_ ‘cock with gray plumage and reddish tail’, [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) _manuk ŋa abúhun_ ‘gray-colored cock’), and perhaps in [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) (cf. [Sasak](LanguageTable#cldf:404) _abu_ ‘ash-gray, specifically of carrier pigeons’).  Finally, both the reduplication of &ast;_qabu_ in various daughter languages, and forms assigned to &ast;_paR-qabu-an_ here may be products of convergence.  The same explanation probably accounts for the agreement of [Kenyah (Long Wat)](LanguageTable#cldf:19298) _umaʔ avew_ ‘kitchen’ with [Kambera](LanguageTable#cldf:678) _uma aü_ ‘cooking place, place of the hearth fire’.",dyen1953[29]

Although reflexes of &ast;_qabu_ ‘ash’ and &ast;_qabuk_ ‘dust’ clearly are distinct in languages which preserve final consonants, the inclusion of [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) reflexes under &ast;_qabuk_ rather than &ast;_qabu_ is based entirely on semantic fit.  Whereas &ast;_qabu_ evidently referred to ashes, and prototypically to the ashen residue in the hearth, &ast;_qabuk_ evidently designated a range of fine particulate matter produced without combustion (despite occasional semantic cross-over, as in the [Sasak](LanguageTable#cldf:404) and [Banggai](LanguageTable#cldf:238) reflexes).  Although only the meanings ‘dust’ and ‘sawdust’ can be justified by the glosses of cognates in primary branches of [MP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081), the meaning ‘powder’ can be added for [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094).  Consideration of the root &ast;[-buk₁](cf.csv#cldf:Root-29852) suggests further that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_qabuk_ probably referred additionally to the powder produced by weevil-infested, or decaying wood.  Finally, [Richardson (1885)](Source#cldf:richardson1885) cites [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432) _maŋ-àvoka_ under _hávoka_, but with a question mark indicating uncertainty regarding the shape of the unaffixed stem.",richardson1885

For reasons that remain unclear, most members of the Cordilleran and Central Luzon subgroups of Philippine languages ([Blust 1991](Source#cldf:blust1991)) reflect &ast;_qaRtay_; although &ast;_-R-_ in these reflexes appears to be infixed, it has no identifiable meaning.  Similar phonological problems are found with some other forms (e.g. [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:19083) &ast;_qaRta_; reflexes of &ast;_qata_ ‘outsiders, alien people’), but in most cases a doublet can be reconstructed.  


A number of other interesting problems are connected with this form, including the following:",blust1991

Although the comparison of [Kapampangan](LanguageTable#cldf:291) _antipa_ is straightforward, the inclusion of most phonetically similar [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) forms in this set is problematic.  [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_C_ normally became [Bunun](LanguageTable#cldf:250) /_t_/, and is reflected as /_s_/ only exceptionally (e.g. &ast;_CebuS_ > _sibus_ ‘sugarcane’). Both [Saisiyat](LanguageTable#cldf:400) /_s_/ and [Pazeh](LanguageTable#cldf:375) /_s_/ can reflect &ast;_C_, but [Saisiyat](LanguageTable#cldf:400) _kaesipaʔ_ shows an unexpected initial consonant, and [Pazeh](LanguageTable#cldf:375) _sipaʔ_ shows unexplained loss of the first syllable.  Moreover, as noted by [Tsuchida (1976:291)](Source#cldf:tsuchida1976) the expected [Tsou](LanguageTable#cldf:1087) reflex is &ast;&ast;_cipo_. 


 It thus appears likely that most of the [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) forms have been borrowed, presumably from some other [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) source which either no longer exists, or which is yet to be identified.  Both this observation and the glosses in languages such as [Pazeh](LanguageTable#cldf:375) and [Kapampangan](LanguageTable#cldf:291) make it more likely that [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_qaCipa_ and [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_qantipa_ referred to the ocean-dwelling hawksbill turtle, which is prized for its widely-traded shell, than to the economically unimportant land tortoise.

[Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) reconstructed &ast;_asem_, and many contemporary languages appear to reflect a disyllable.  We might, therefore, posit three variants: &ast;_qalesem_, &ast;_qaRsem_ and &ast;_qasem_.  Apart from its disturbing proliferation of variants there is a fundamental phonological problem with this interpretation: &ast;_qalesem_ and &ast;_qaRsem_ clearly are distinct, but the evidence for &ast;_qasem_ is generally compatible with &ast;_qalesem_.  On the assumption that the [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) and [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) forms show cluster reduction (with [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) optionally reducing the cluster or breaking it up by metathesis), no Philippine language supports &ast;_qasem_.  Moreover, as noted in [Blust (1982)](Source#cldf:blust1982) there is persuasive evidence that [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) syncopated vowels in the environment VC-CV, with reduction of a resulting cluster of two obstruents. 


Cognates of the material cited in [Blust (1982)](Source#cldf:blust1982) suggest that much the same type of change took place in many of the languages of western Indonesia.  Evidence for &ast;_qalesem_ is not confined to the languages of the _Philippines_, but includes two types of Bornean reflexes: 1) [Lun Dayeh](LanguageTable#cldf:19418) _me-lam_ ‘sour’ and [Kelabit](LanguageTable#cldf:299) _laam_ ‘sour’ preserve a reflex of &ast;_l_, with loss of the first syllable (&ast;_qalesem_ > &ast;_elesem_ > &ast;_lesem_ > &ast;_lehem_ > &ast;_lahem_ > &ast;_laem_ > /laam/), 2) forms such as [Bisaya (Limbang)](LanguageTable#cldf:542) _m-usom_, [Kayan](LanguageTable#cldf:294) _sem_ ‘sour’ contain a penultimate reflex of shwa, not &ast;_a_.  Since all of the North Sarawak and Sabahan languages for which information is available have neutralized the opposition of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_a_ and &ast;_e_ in prepenultimate syllables ([Blust 1974](Source#cldf:blust1974)) these forms are most simply explained as having undergone the first of the changes just cited (&ast;_qalesem_ > &ast;_elesem_), followed by syncopation of medial &ast;_e_, cluster reduction and loss of initial shwa (&ast;_elesem_ > &ast;_elsem_ > &ast;_esem_ > _sem_).  The reconstruction of &ast;_qalesem qalesem_ (rather than &ast;_qasem qasem_) ‘small sour plant with clover-like leaves’ follows from this wider comparative picture.  Finally, since most [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) languages have syncopated &ast;_e_ in the environment VC-CV, there is little direct evidence for the medial vowel in &ast;_qalesem_.  Yet to reconstruct [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) &ast;_qalsem_ would violate a well-established canonical shape which allows medial consonant clusters to consist only of homorganically prenasalized obstruents (including &ast;_-ŋs-_), of preconsonantal &ast;_R_, or of the abutting consonants in reduplicated monosyllables.  [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_qaRsem_ does not violate this constraint, yet appears to be ambiguous for &ast;_qaRsem_ or &ast;_qaResem_.",dempwolff193438;blust1982;blust1982;blust1974

[Dyen (1953:14, and fn. 55)](Source#cldf:dyen1953) included the [Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434) word on the grounds that the change of &ast;_l_ to /_n_/ was a conditioned change (&ast;_l_ regularly became _n_ when preceding a syllable that contained a nasal).

[Amis](LanguageTable#cldf:227) _ʔalol_ ‘be carried away by water so that it is no longer seen’ is phonologically compatible with &ast;_qaluR_, but is semantically a better match with &ast;_qañud_.  The resemblance between it and reflexes of &ast;_qaluR_ is perhaps best treated as a product of chance.

Since no system of terms for the cardinal directions can be reconstructed for any early Austronesian proto-language, and since terms for the west and east monsoons were important from at least [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) times, it appears most likely that [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_qamiS_ meant ‘north wind’.  Under this hypothesis [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_qamiS-an_ (lit. ‘place of the north wind’) would have meant ‘north’ or ‘winter’.  In [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) the morpheme boundary separating &ast;_qamiS_ from the locative suffix was lost, yielding a new trisyllabic base &ast;_qamihan_, which took over the original meaning of &ast;_qamiS_ ‘north wind’.  History then repeated itself, and the locative suffix &ast;_-an_ was added to the new and longer [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) base to yield &ast;_qamihan-an_ (lit. ‘place of the north wind’) now meaning ‘north; rainy season’, since speakers of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) had at this point advanced too far south for the recognition of temperate seasonality to any longer have a meaning.",

It would be attractive to unite &ast;_qani-Ruan_ and &ast;_qari-ñuan_ under a single reconstruction.  Since reflexes of (a) in our data are both more common and more widely attested (being found in [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) and [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076) languages), &ast;_qani-Ruan_ is perhaps the preferred shape of such an invariant prototype.  But under this interpretation we must recognize at least three independent metatheses ([Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279), the Bornean forms, [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427)), of which the second followed the sporadic palatalization of &ast;_n_ before _i_.  An invariant prototype &ast;_qari-ñuan_ not only exacerbates this problem, but cannot account for the stem-initial _g_ of various Philippine reflexes.  This difficulty might be alleviated by positing &ast;_qaRi-ñuan_, but among other obstacles to such an interpretation independent evidence for a prefix &ast;_qaRi-_ is unknown.  On balance, then, the reconstruction of doublets with complementary affixation, though not entirely problem-free, appears preferable to an invariant prototype.

Given the insecure conditions in which tribal societies often lived it is hardly surprising that the notion ‘stranger’ would easily include that of ‘enemy’, and the delicate ambivalence between guest and enemy (the positive reception of the outsider vs. the negative reception of the outsider) that is so penetratingly discussed in the Indo-European context by [Benveniste (1973:71-83)](Source#cldf:benveniste1973) is also reflected in various forms of this term, which include ‘enemy’, ‘stranger’, ‘guest’ and ‘one’s own villagers’.",benveniste1973[71-83]

Evidence from [Kayan](LanguageTable#cldf:294), [Kenyah](LanguageTable#cldf:300), [Bukat](LanguageTable#cldf:557), and perhaps [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276), all of which preserve the &ast;_n/ñ_ distinction, also contradicts the reconstruction of a palatal nasal, and it is now clear that the palatal nasal of Land Dayak forms such as [Bidayuh (Bukar-Sadong)](LanguageTable#cldf:18961) is best treated as a product of secondary assimilation.  Animal, plant, and human integuments were represented in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) by two distinct terms.

27597,*qaNiCu,q,"ghost, spirit of the dead; owl","Also [Proto-Atayalic](LanguageTable#cldf:19073) &ast;_ʔaliutux_ ‘ghost’.  It is evident that &ast;_qaNiCu_ represented an important concept in traditional Austronesian-speaking societies.

The reference to ‘owl’ in [Puyuma](LanguageTable#cldf:386), [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), and [Sundanese](LanguageTable#cldf:418) suggests that this bird has long been regarded as a spectral manifestation in the Austronesian-speaking world, while the scattered references to plants ([Itbayaten](LanguageTable#cldf:282), [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Buginese](LanguageTable#cldf:239), [Ngadha](LanguageTable#cldf:357)) are perhaps best illuminated by [Wilkinson's (1959)](Source#cldf:wilkinson1959) gloss for [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _hantu_.",wilkinson1959

Based on [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _aníno_ ‘shadow; reflection’, [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) _halinu_ ‘shadow; reflection’ [Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) reconstructed &ast;_ali[n]u_ ‘shade, shadow, spirit’, but his comparison shows irregularities in both languages, and an etymon with this shape cannot be justified by any known evidence.  


The problem that Dempwolff faced in dealing with this comparison was created by 1. a limited choice of languages from which to select cognates, and 2. the extreme variability of seemingly related forms meaning ‘shadow; reflection’, and often by extension ‘soul, spirit of a living being’ (for the identification of the soul with the shadow or reflection as a culture universal cf. [Tylor (1958 [1871]:2:14ff)](bib-Tylor).  Since [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) reflexes of &ast;_qaNiŋu_ and [MP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) reflexes of &ast;_qaninu_ are complementary in terms of hierarchically ordered subgroups I have assumed that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_qaninu_ is a lineal continuation of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_qaniŋu_ with irregular change of the second nasal.  Similarly, it would be possible to interpret [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_qanunu_ ‘shadow; reflection; soul’ as an irregularly altered form of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) (and [PCEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19074)) &ast;_qaninu_, except that [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372) _lechúl_ ‘scar; shadow’ appears to reflect &ast;_qanunu_ (with metathesis of the first two consonants), thus requiring the coexistence of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_qaninu_ and &ast;_qanunu_ as doublets.",dempwolff193438
27616,*qaNuaŋ,q,"large ruminant species: carabao, water buffalo (?)","Many reflexes of &ast;_qaNuaŋ_ have lost the first syllable with no apparent conditioning.  In languages of the _northern Philippines_  such foreshortening may have been favored by oxytonality in a polysyllable which came to be vowel-initial, but no rule can be stated.  The referent of &ast;_qaNuaŋ_ is a matter of some interest.  While this morpheme clearly referred to a large ruminant mammal, this leaves open several possibilities, including: 1. the larger variety of deer (_Cervus equinus_, or _Cervus unicolor_), which were widely hunted for their pelts in Taiwan at the time of European contact, 2. the carabao, or water buffalo, and 3. some other form of bovid.  


The first of these choices is in some ways the least problematic, although 1) it cannot be justified by reflexes in both [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) and [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) languages, and 2) [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) &ast;_u(R)sa(h)_ must have meant ‘deer, _Cervus_ spp.’, leaving [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) &ast;_qanuaŋ_ with what presumably was some other meaning.  If [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_qaNuaŋ_ and [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) &ast;_qanuaŋ_ had the same referent, then (and there is no reason to believe otherwise), it apparently was not ‘Cervus spp.’.  It is noteworthy that reflexes of &ast;_qaNuaŋ_ refer to unique species of wild buffalo or antelope both in Mindoro (_Bubalus mindorensis_), and in Sulawesi (_Anoa depressicornis_).  Neither referent can be original, however, since the species in question are geographically limited, and neither Mindoro nor Sulawesi is a likely Austronesian homeland.  This leaves the carabao as a plausible referent of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_qaNuaŋ_, with subsequent transfer of the term to various wild varieties of buffalo or buffalo-like animals.  Since terms related to [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _kerbau_, [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _kalabáw_ ‘carabao’ are widespread in mainland Southeast Asia, Indonesia and the Philippines, and appear to be loanwords both in Austronesian and in Austroasiatic languages ([Headley 1976:467](Source#cldf:headleyand1976)), it seems likely that the water buffalo was introduced into western Indonesia after the arrival of Austronesian speakers from the north.  The [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) word _kerbau_ then spread with the animal as far north as the central Philippines, but not further north ([McFarland 1977:429](Source#cldf:mcfarland1977)). 


What remains puzzling in all of this is the implication that the carabao was known to speakers of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) (as &ast;_qaNuaŋ_), and that the animal was preserved in Taiwan and the northern Philippines, but lost in areas further to the south. Where the carabao was lost the old name was reapplied to various wild bovids. [Bellwood (1997 [1985]:219-22)](bib-Bellwood) notes that the Lower Yangtze cultures exemplified by, for example, the 7,000-year-old site of Hemudu in the northeastern portion of modern Zhejiang province, show several archaeological traits which make them prime candidates for a pre-[PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) phase of the later Austronesian cultural expansion.  Both the domestic pig and water buffalo were present in Lower Yangtze sites by 5,000 B.C., and it is possible that the water buffalo was transported to Taiwan (although no archaeological confirmation for either pig or water buffalo is yet available for the earliest agricultural levels in Taiwan).  If so, it would make the apparent loss of the water buffalo at a later date further to the south even more puzzling.",headleyand1976[467];mcfarland1977[429]

Although the [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) and [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) words can be reconstructed only in the meaning ‘to hunt wild game’, in a number of Philippine languages reflexes of &ast;_qaNup_ mean both ‘to hunt’ and ‘hunting dog’.",

On the basis of apparent irregularities in some [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) reflexes [Tsuchida (1976:200-201)](Source#cldf:tsuchida1976) reconstructs a final palatal in this form, hence &ast;_qañu(zZ)_.  However, the reconstruction of final &ast;_z_ or &ast;_Z_ is unparalleled, and runs counter to well-established constraints on the occurrence of final palatals other than &ast;_j_ (which may have been a palatalized velar rather than a true palatal) in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072), [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) and [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) morphemes generally.

27621,*qapejuq,q,"gall, gall bladder, bile",,
27622,*qapejux,q,"gall, gall bladder, bile","Also [Saisiyat](LanguageTable#cldf:400) _paeʔzoʔ_ ‘gall’, [Proto-Rukai](LanguageTable#cldf:19086) &ast;_pago_ ‘gall’, PTso &ast;_paʔ₁azu_ ‘gall bladder’ ([Tsuchida 1976:224](Source#cldf:tsuchida1976)), [Bontok](LanguageTable#cldf:246) _akgó_ ‘gall bladder’, [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) _apró_ ‘bile, gall’, [Bintulu](LanguageTable#cldf:242) _ləpəɗəw_ ‘gall, gall bladder’, [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _lempedu_ ‘spleen, gall’, [Simalur](LanguageTable#cldf:415) _ampadu_ ‘gall, gall bladder’, [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285) _rempelu_ ‘pancreas’, [Bimanese](LanguageTable#cldf:241) _folu_ ‘gall’.  [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_qapejux_ and its reflexes in other early proto-languages apparently referred both to the gall bladder and to its contents, although these are distinguished by modifiers in some attested languages (e.g. [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276) _aiʔ empedu_ ‘bile, gall’ = ‘liquid of the gall bladder’; [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _pundi-pundi (h)empedu_ ‘gall bladder’ = ‘sac of the gall’).  


As is evident from several glosses cited here, the gall of various (mostly domesticated?) animals was widely used in augury, although specific details cannot be reconstructed.  Most notably, a morphologically complex expression which juxtaposed a morpheme or sequence of morphemes meaning ‘without’ or ‘not having’ with the word for ‘gall’ was used in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) to describe a person who lacked good judgement or a clear understanding of cultural expectations (cf. reflexes in [Kelabit](LanguageTable#cldf:299), [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314), [Tontemboan](LanguageTable#cldf:19052), [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947), and [Manggarai](LanguageTable#cldf:816)).  Unlike the case in European languages such as English, German, or French, where human gall typically is associated with emotions that are negative or out of control (anger, bitterness), reflexes of &ast;_qapejux_ in this expression (and in [Tiruray](LanguageTable#cldf:433) _fedew_) are associated with positive character traits and/or social values.  


At the same time the physical bitterness of gall has worked its way into the meanings of some reflexes, or into various expressions using a reflex of &ast;_qapejux_ which are cited in the sources consulted here (reflexes in [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423), [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252), [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331), [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432), [Sangir](LanguageTable#cldf:402), [Hawu](LanguageTable#cldf:405) and [Rotinese](LanguageTable#cldf:395), and such expressions as [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _pahit daripada hempedu_ ‘more bitter than gall’.",tsuchida1976[224]

[Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) _hampelas_ exhibits the borrowed ([Banjarese](LanguageTable#cldf:243)) reflex of &ast;_q-_, but the native reflex of &ast;_e_ ([Dyen 1956:85](Source#cldf:dyen1956)); I assume that it is a [Banjarese](LanguageTable#cldf:243) loan which took place prior to the change of &ast;_e_ to [Banjarese](LanguageTable#cldf:243) /_a_/.  Since all three languages which reflect an initial consonant have merged [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_q-_ and &ast;_h-_, the initial consonant of &ast;_qapelas_ evidently is ambiguous.  [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _haplás_ ‘rubbing application of liniment’ and similar forms in other Philippine languages are assumed to be distinct.

Although [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_apij_ can only be glossed ‘twins’, it appears that [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) &ast;_apij_ referred both to twins and to double fruits, particularly fused bananas.  The recurrent references to double bananas in such [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) languages as [Kayan (Uma Juman)](LanguageTable#cldf:438) and [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245), and the parallel association of twinning with humans and fruits in the similar but non-corresponding [Amis](LanguageTable#cldf:227) and [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314) forms, raise the possibility that &ast;_apij_ ‘twins’ and &ast;_qapid_ ‘braid, twine’ are actually the same morpheme (since both the strands of a braided rope, and double bananas are joined along the length).  However, &ast;_qapid_ appears definitely to end in &ast;_d_, and if [Roviana](LanguageTable#cldf:396) _avisi_ truly belongs in this cognate set (and not with &ast;_Sabij_), &ast;_apij_ must end in &ast;_j_.",

Based on proposed cognates in [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423), [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427), [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285), [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), and [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) [Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) proposed &ast;_pucuk_ ‘peak’.  [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _pusók_ ‘ardor, impetuousity’, appears to support Dempwolff's reconstruction of a disyllabic base, but is of questionable cognation.  Finally, [Bare'e](LanguageTable#cldf:236) sometimes preserves prepenultimate &ast;_a_ which came to be initial (e.g. &ast;_qapeju_ > _apoju_ ‘gall’), and sometimes loses it (e.g. &ast;_qateluR_ > _toyu_ ‘egg’).",dempwolff193438

[PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_qapuR_ and its descendant forms are one of the key elements in the linguistic evidence for the betel culture which accompanied Austronesian speakers as they spread from island Southeast Asia into the western Pacific.  Betel-chewing spread as far as the Southeastern Solomons, but either never reached Vanuatu and points further south and east, or was replaced in those areas by the later, innovative consumption of kava (_Piper methisticum_), which evidently had its origin in Vanuatu ([Crowley 1990](Source#cldf:crowley1990)).  


Scattered references in a number of the sources clearly indicate that lime was made by the burning of mollusc shells or coral limestone, and in the earlier phases of Austronesian expansion was carried on the person in a small gourd container (later replaced in island Southeast Asia by the brass betel box).  Lime may also have been used as a whitewash (oblique references in [Amis](LanguageTable#cldf:227) and [Kwaio](LanguageTable#cldf:307)), and by at least [PCEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19074) times, if not earlier, lime powder evidently was blown as a ritual gesture of some type (references in [Tetun](LanguageTable#cldf:1060) and ['Āre'āre](LanguageTable#cldf:18004)). 


The comparisons of lime to sago flesh in two widely separated languages ([Kenyah](LanguageTable#cldf:300) and [Fordata](LanguageTable#cldf:18184)) are interesting, but difficult to interpret without more context.  [Tiruray](LanguageTable#cldf:433) _fag-aful-an_ (for anticipated &ast;&ast;_ferafuran_, from &ast;_paR-qapuR-an_) is assumed to be a loan from a still unidentified source, but problems remain even with this interpretation (&ast;_R_ > /g/ in the prefix, but &ast;_R_ > /l/ in the stem).  It is possible that the reconstruction of &ast;_paR-qapuR-an_, a form that appears to have been entirely synonymous with &ast;_paŋ-qapuR-an_, is simply misguided.  Finally, [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573) _Hu naʔye afok i maiʔes_ ‘I put lime on the corn’ and [Wetan](LanguageTable#cldf:1118) _air-i_ ‘lime, put lime on’ appear to reflect two stages in the history of the suffix &ast;_-i_ ‘local transitive’, the first while it still remains a generic preposition marking location in space or time, and the second after it has become a transitive verb suffix with locative overtones.",crowley1990

Many words which may reflect &ast;_qaqay_ are ambiguous for &ast;_qaqay_ or &ast;_waqay_.  The loss of &ast;_q_ and contraction of the resulting sequence of like vowels in this form led to a canonically atypical monosyllabic content word /_ay_/ in some languages.  In response to canonical pressure this sequence was resyllabified as /_ai_/, or even /_ayi_/.  Where the final diphthong had been monophthongized to -/_e_/ prior to loss of &ast;_q_ such pressures were inapplicable. 


 It is noteworthy that although a single term appears to have been used for both ‘foot’ and ‘leg’ in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072), [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) and [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094), such parts of the leg as the shin (&ast;_lulud_), calf (&ast;_bitiqis_) and thigh (&ast;_paqa_) were terminologically distinguished by at least [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) times, and reflexes of the latter two have often replaced reflexes of &ast;_qaqay_ in the meaning ‘foot, leg’.",warren1959

27635,*qari-ñuan,q,a small bee: Apis indica,"Also [Simalur](LanguageTable#cldf:415) _aniwan_ ‘wild bee’, [Malay (Jakarta)](LanguageTable#cldf:18430) _ñaruan_ ‘bee or hornet’, [Sasak](LanguageTable#cldf:404) _keñeruh_, _keñeruhan_ ‘bee’.  It would be attractive to unit (a) and (b) under a single etymon, relating forms such as [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) _arinuán_ and [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _neruan_ through metathesis.  Since the known reflexes of (a) are both more common and more widely attested than those of (b) (being found in [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) _and_ [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076) languages), &ast;_qani-Ruan_ is perhaps the preferred shape of such an invariant prototype.  But under this interpretation we must recognize at least three independent metatheses ([Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279), the Bornean forms, [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427)), of which the second followed the sporadic palatalization of &ast;_n_ before &ast;_i_.  


An invariant prototype &ast;_qari-ñuan_ not only exacerbates this problem, but cannot account for the stem-initial _g_ of various Philippine reflexes. This difficulty might be alleviated by positing &ast;_qaRi-ñuan_, but among other obstacles to such an interpretation independent evidence for a prefix &ast;_qaRi-_ is unknown.  On balance, then, the reconstruction of doublets with complementary affixation, although not without its problems, appears preferable to an invariant prototype.

[Tsuchida (1976:318)](Source#cldf:tsuchida1976) posits ‘PHES’ doublets, &ast;_qaRem_, _qaRum_, but almost all of the supporting evidence for the latter variant is ambiguous for &ast;_e_ or &ast;_u_.  


Two species of scaly anteater or pangolin are found in island Southeast Asia: 1. the _Manis pentadactyla_, and 2. the _Manis javanica_ Desmarest.  The former is confined to Taiwan, while the latter has a fairly wide distribution including the island of Palawan and the adjacent Kalamian and Cuyo Islands in the Philippines, the Greater Sunda Islands of Indonesia, including Borneo, Sumatra and Java, and portions of the Southeast Asian mainland ([Taylor 1934](Source#cldf:taylor1934)). 


 Since the islands where the more southerly species is found all rest on the submerged Sunda Shelf, and since this is not true of any other Philippine islands, it is likely that the _Manis javanica_ acquired its attested distribution at a time when the Greater Sunda Islands of Indonesia and the Palawan group of the Philippines were joined with the Asian mainland.  [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_qaRem_ presumably referred to the _Manis pentadactyla_, but since its reflexes refer to both species we are faced with a puzzle: how did the name for ‘pangolin’ survive when Austronesian speakers moved south into parts of the Philippines where pangolins were not found?

[Grace (1972)](Source#cldf:grace1972) suggests that [Canala](LanguageTable#cldf:568) (New Caledonia) _ka_ ‘enemy, one to be killed and eaten’ may be connected, but this would be the only known reflex of &ast;_qaRta_ in an [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) language, and in view of the phonemic brevity of the form I do not see how convergence can safely be excluded as an explanation of the observed similarity.  [Reid (1989:51)](Source#cldf:reid1989), [Reid (n.d.)](bib-Reid) posits &ast;_qaRtaq_, a form which is supported by several Central Philippine  witnesses as noted above, but which is in conflict with the absence of a final consonant in at least [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423), Sama-Bajaw, [Proto-Minahasan](LanguageTable#cldf:19080), [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245), [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372), and [Rembong](LanguageTable#cldf:391).  Since the latter languages form a rather diverse collection, it is simpler to hypothesize an irregular change in one Central Philippine  language which diffused to surrounding speech communities rather than an irregular loss of &ast;_-q_ on as many as six historically independent occasions. 


 Finally, the arguments presented in [Blust (1972)](Source#cldf:blust1972) for assigning a meaning ‘outsiders, alien people’ to this form now appear stronger than ever.  Based on ‘occurrences of unique alleles’ [Bellwood (1997 [1985])](bib-Bellwood) notes that the Negritos of Luzon and Mindanao probably have been separated for over 10,000 years.  The distribution of phenotypically similar Negrito populations in the interior of the Malay Peninsula and in the Andaman Islands suggests that a Negrito population was widespread in island Southeast Asia when phenotypically southern Mongoloid Austronesian-speaking populations began to arrive in the region.  [Blust (1981)](Source#cldf:blust1981) argues for cultural contact and borrowing of animistic beliefs between indigenous Negrito and incoming Austronesian -speaking groups by about 3,000 B.C.  


Most recently [Reid (1987)](Source#cldf:reid1987) has argued persuasively that incoming agricultural Austronesians must have encountered an established Negrito hunter-gatherer population in the Philippines which over the course of time assimilated linguistically to the new arrivals.  Under such conditions it is not difficult to see how &ast;_qaRta_ would have been applied by Austronesian speakers to the Negrito population of the Philippines, and ultimately adopted as a self-designation by some of these same groups.  In other areas the term came to be applied to outsiders taken in war whose social position was that of ‘slave’ (someone with no claims to filiation with lineages of the dominant group).  More puzzling are the semantic innovations which caused &ast;_qaRta_ to replace [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_tau_ in the meaning ‘person, human being’.",grace1972;reid1989[51];blust1972;blust1981;reid1987

[PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_qaRus_ clearly meant ‘current’ (either of rivers or the sea), but also appears to have functioned verbally in the meaning ‘to flow’.  Agreements in widely separated reflexes suggest that in its verbal sense &ast;_qaRus_ referred to a viscous, slow, heavy movement, probably in contrast to a rushing flow of liquid ([PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_deRes_).  Thus both [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) _águs_ and [Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434) _ʔau_ refer to the oozing of pus (the latter in explicit contrast to the flowing of blood), and [Nias](LanguageTable#cldf:361) _mo-ho-hou_ and [Motu](LanguageTable#cldf:345) _aru_ refer to the slowly flowing movement of crowds of people.

Reflexes both of this word and of the doublet [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_qiCeluR_, [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_qiteluR_ are widely distributed, although the latter appear to be confined to _Taiwan_, the _Philippines_ and _western Indonesia_  (Borneo, south Sulawesi).  Many reflexes both in western and in eastern Indonesia are ambiguous for the two prototypes, as they regularly lose a prepenultimate initial syllable which began with a vowel or laryngeal.  



The appearance of a great variety of irregularities in reflexes of this word in many languages is puzzling, and may be connected with taboo in connection with the meaning ‘testicle’.  For the widespread occurrence of an ‘egg/testicle’ equation in natural languages cf. [Brown and Witkowski (1981)](Source#cldf:brownandwitkowski1981).",brownandwitkowski1981

This widely distributed comparison is unreported in Taiwan, and although it is extremely common in the Philippines, it is replaced in Sama-Bajaw and in most of the languages of Borneo by reflexes of &ast;_sapaw_. In Borneo reflexes of &ast;_qatep_ appear only in the Malayic languages, and in Sumatra reflexes of &ast;_qatep_ have been reported only from the Malayic languages and [Rejang](LanguageTable#cldf:389).  It is likewise lacking in the Chamic languages and in [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432), but is otherwise very well attested throughout the Austronesian family.  The glosses cited here suggest that the sword grass, _Imperata cylindrica_, was the favored roofing material in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081), but as Austronesian speakers moved southward into a more tropical environment thatching was more commonly made of the fronds of palms, particularly of the nipa palm (_Nipa fruticans_) and sago palm (_Metroxylon sagu_) in Southeast Asia, and of the sago palm or pandanus in the insular Pacific.",

Citing [Burkill (1935)](bib-Burkill), [Verheijen (1984:51)](Source#cldf:verheijen1984) states that ‘the cucumber is certainly no native of any part of Asia further east than India’, yet concludes that it must have some antiquity in the Austronesian world. The broader linguistic evidence considered here supports the same conclusions. Although [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) reflexes are yet to be found, the presence of cognate [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) forms such as the phonologically irregular [Motu](LanguageTable#cldf:345) _asemo_, and [Fijian](LanguageTable#cldf:266) _timo_ ‘a plant: _Cucumis acidus_’ suggests that _Cucumis sativa_ was present in the Austronesian world by 1,400 B.C.  At the same time, the frequent appearance of last-syllable /_o_/ for expected /_u_/ is puzzling, and may point to early borrowing.",verheijen1984[51]
27669,*qatiŋ,q,"sweat, perspiration",,
27666,*qatip₁,q,part of the loom,"Also [Kavalan](LanguageTable#cldf:293) _ŋatip_ ‘cloth beam (part of the loom)’, [Rotinese](LanguageTable#cldf:395) _ati(s)_ ‘that part of the loom that the weaver has before her’ ([Jonker (1908)](Source#cldf:jonker1908)); ‘loom-beam or breast beam at the front of the loom (these are two pieces of wood at the front of the loom, in front of the weaver, to which is attached the back strap; reference to the loom (by one of its parts)’ ([Fox, J. 1993](Source#cldf:fox1993a)), [Tetun](LanguageTable#cldf:1060) _atis_ ‘fine cloth, or cloth still on the loom; a part of the loom’.  


Although the precise meaning of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_qatip_ cannot be determined from the available evidence, it seems fairly clear that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_qatip_ referred to a pair of rods at the base of the loom (on or near the weaver's lap) upon which the woven cloth was rolled as it was finished.  Since there is no basis for inferring any other meanings in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) it is perhaps safest to assume a continuation of the same semantic category from the earliest reconstructible stage.",jonker1908;fox1993a

Its leaves are also used for filling in the outer walls of houses’.  


The initial syllable of this form has been irregularly lost in a number of languages.  There are two plausible bases for such a loss: 1) the predominant disyllabic canonical form of most [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) languages would have favored a foreshortened form, 2) in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) all common nouns were preceded by the common noun marker &ast;_na_.  So long as &ast;_qatita_ retained an initial consonant there was little danger of a confusion between its penultimate vowel and the vowel of &ast;_na_.  After the loss of &ast;_q_, however, &ast;_na atita_ would expectably contract to &ast;_natita_ in rapid speech, thereby ultimately giving rise to uncertainty as to whether the bare noun was _atita_ or _tita_.",

In general [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _tuhan_ ‘God’ provides a better semantic fit than _tuan_ with the other forms cited here, but the medial _h_ disagrees with Polynesian witnesses such as [Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434) and [Rennellese](LanguageTable#cldf:390).  

Concerning this form [Wilkinson (1959:1242)](Source#cldf:wilkinson1959) has the following comment: ‘Many Malays attach importance to a medial _H_ and distinguish between _Tuhan_ (the divine Lord) and _tuan_ (our sovereign on earth); _peŋhulu_ (our head in divine things) and _peŋulu_ (a chief in secular matters).  It may be that _Tuhan_ is an artificial variant of _tuan_ as some say.’",wilkinson1959[1242]

This term evidently referred to the big-eye scad, but may also have designated other types of middle-sized fish that swarm in large schools in the shallow water of lagoons, including various sea breams.",
27672,*qatun,q,"a fish, the skipjack tuna or bonito","Also [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _atún_ ‘tunny fish’.  In [Blust (1983-1984)](Source#cldf:blust198384) I reconstructed [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_qatun_ and added: ""[Panganiban (1966)](Source#cldf:panganiban1966) marks [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _atún_ (with /_u_/ for expected /_o_/) as a Spanish loan, but under his interpretation the agreement with [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) forms is unexplained.  Given this comparison it would appear more likely that Spanish _atún_ is a loan from [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) or some other Philippine language.""  It now appears that [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _atún_ is, indeed, a Spanish loan.  For Spanish _atún_ [Serrano (1872)](Source#cldf:serrano1872) gives [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _bangús na malaquing dinaing_, and [Laktaw (1914)](Source#cldf:laktaw1914) gives [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _bangús na malakí_, the first gloss meaning ‘big dried/salted milkfish’ and the latter simply ‘big milkfish’.  Neither author list _atún_ as a [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) word.  Given the lack of supporting evidence from any other non-[Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082)  language there appears to be no choice except to limit the reconstruction of &ast;_qatun_ to [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082).  


We are then confronted with the question of where Spanish got the word.  [Corominas and Pascual (1980)](bib-Corominas) note that Spanish _atún_, Portuguese _atum_ ‘albacore, tuna’ generally is thought to derive from Arabic _tûn_.  However, they do not suggest even an approximate date for its introduction, and point out that: 1. under this hypothesis the initial vowel is unexplained, and 2. the borrowing of such a term is problematic, given the traditionally great importance of albacore fishing on the Andalusian coast of the Atlantic.  They note, moreover, that the Arabic term itself is thought to originate ultimately from Latin _thŭnnus_ ‘tunny fish’, and indicate that a straightforward Latin reflex appears in Portuguese _toninha/toninho_ ‘young of the albacore (also used of the albacore in general)’.  


It is obvious from the discussion in Corominas and Pascual that the traditional etymology of Spanish _atún_ is unsatisfactory in more than one respect, and it is equally obvious that the Spanish term could not be borrowed from [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423).This leaves only one, somewhat surprising hypothesis to consider: that the Spanish borrowed the term from an [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082)> language which preserved final consonants.  This would limit the possible sources to the Solomon Islands and portions of the Bismarck Archipelago.  The Mendaña expedition of 1567-68 discovered the main chain of the Solomon islands, and a Spanish settlement was established on Nendö Island in the Santa Cruz group in 1595 ([Allen 1976](Source#cldf:allen1976)).  It is perhaps during these early years of Pacific exploration that the term became established in Spanish, since bonito trawling was an activity of great practical and even ritual importance in various parts of this region.  


In the Southeast Solomons the cultural expression of interest in the bonito reaches an almost cult-like intensity ([Ivens 1972 [1927]:130ff](bib-Ivens)).  Phonological considerations rule out the _Southeast Solomons_  as a source of the term, but it could perhaps have been acquired from an OC language further to the west, or even conceivably from [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573) if a cognate of [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_qatun_ was once found in that language but was subsequently lost (cf. [Thompson 1945:31](Source#cldf:thompson1945) for references to ‘the ancient custom of trawling for bonitos and flying fish’ among the early Chamorros).",blust198384;panganiban1966;serrano1872;laktaw1914;allen1976;thompson1945[31]
27673,*qatuR₁,q,"pave with stones; pile or stack up, arrange, order, put in sequence","Also [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) _ator-an_ ‘pave with stones; governor; order, arrangement’, _ator-en_ ‘arrange; careful; fix up; stony’, [Melanau (Mukah)](LanguageTable#cldf:349) _tuh_ ‘arrange, put in order’, [Banjarese](LanguageTable#cldf:243) _atur_ ‘arrange’, _ba-atur_ ‘put in stacks’, _ba-atur-an_ ‘order, arrange’, [Sika](LanguageTable#cldf:414) _ator_ ‘in a row’, [Rarotongan](LanguageTable#cldf:388) _atū_ ‘a group: compounded with the name of islands, such as _atu-Iti_, _atu-Tonga_, etc.’  There are numerous related forms in [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) and [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076) languages which I have not cited above because phonological irregularities indicate that this word was widely borrowed from [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326).  Since this cannot be the case in the eastern Pacific, and is unlikely in those [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076) forms which show close semantic agreement with their [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) cognates (meanings such as ‘in a row’) the reconstruction of [PCEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19074) &ast;_qatur_ appears to be unavoidable.  The only remaining questions, then, are: 1. are [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) forms such as [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _(h)atur_ cognate with reflexes of [PCEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19074) &ast;_qatur_?, and 2. which non-[OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) forms are directly inherited, and which are [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) loanwords?  With regard to the first question I follow [Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) in affirming a connection. However, Dempwolff clearly erred in including e.g. [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _hátol_ ‘sentence pronounced by a judge in court; counsel; medical prescription for an ailment’ as a directly inherited cognate of the other forms in his comparison, since [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) /_h_/- cannot be united under a single formula with e.g. [Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434) /_ʔ_/-.

However, the references to specific domesticated animals in such languages as [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423), [Murik](LanguageTable#cldf:869), and [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), and the more oblique semantic indications in reflexes such as [Dampelas](LanguageTable#cldf:18954) _n-eaŋ_ ‘tame’ strongly suggest that &ast;_qayam_ referred exclusively to domesticated animals.

The relationship of &ast;_qayam_ ‘domesticated animal’ to &ast;_qayam_ ‘bird’, and to &ast;_qayam_ ‘to play; plaything, toy; pet’ remains problematic, but the rather clear need to reconstruct a [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) term meaning ‘domesticated animal’ would seem to contradict the ‘zoological life-form encoding sequence’ proposed by [Brown (1984:24, and elsewhere)](Source#cldf:brown1984), which maintains that such broad generic lexical categories are everywhere a late development in human languages.","brown1984[24, and elsewhere]"

Given the corroboratory references to insanity in the ['Āre'āre](LanguageTable#cldf:18004) and [Rennellese](LanguageTable#cldf:390) glosses, we might infer a longstanding belief among [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082)-speaking peoples that only the deranged would eat fish or other normally cooked food raw.  However, although they are quite distinct within the [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) branch of Austronesian, both ['Āre'āre](LanguageTable#cldf:18004) and [Rennellese](LanguageTable#cldf:390) are spoken in the southeastern Solomons, and it is possible that the belief in question is a Southeast Solomonic trait which has been adopted by the Polynesian settlers of Rennell and Bellona.  This interpretation is strengthened by the rather matter-of-fact descriptions of the human consumption of raw food in most societies in Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia, and by the common semantic reflexes of &ast;_qetaq_ throughout the Solomons (and nowhere else) which refer to pigs breaking into gardens and eating the produce before it can be harvested and cooked.",

Reflexes of &ast;_ia_ are used as exclamations in many contemporary languages, but the nature of the exclamation differs widely. The two meanings that are shared by both [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094)  and [CEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19074)  languages are 1. a particle expressing affirmation or inviting confirmation and 2. a particle used to urge the hearer on.  In both of these functions it appears likely that &ast;_ia_ ‘exclamation’ represents a semantic extension of &ast;_ia_ ‘3sg.’.  In a few languages a reflex of &ast;_ia_ has been combined with other morphemes to form an exclamation (or occasionally a probable earlier exclamation which has been transformed into a purely referential expression): cp. [Kankanaey](LanguageTable#cldf:289) _siá_ ‘yes, yea, aye’, [Ifugaw](LanguageTable#cldf:636) _hiá_ ‘as an answer to a question, means ""yes"", ""it is so"", or ""exactly"", [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _siá_ ‘so be it! amen!’; _siá ŋaʔ_ ‘it's true, it is certainly so’, ['Āre'āre](LanguageTable#cldf:18004) _inaia_ ‘3sg.; exclamation of assent: yes, that's it!’, [Mota](LanguageTable#cldf:344) _ineia_ ‘3sg.; that's it!’, and  [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) (where _ia_, _dia_ = ‘3sg.’) _yaitu_ ‘that is to say’, from &ast;_ia_ ‘3sg.’ + &ast;_itu_ ‘2sg. deictic’, as against the historically more recent and morphologically more transparent _itu dia_ ‘that's it! that's  the one!’, with the semantically equivalent elements in the opposite order.",

However, no non-Austronesian  source has yet been found for it, and the semantically rather different cognates in [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577), the Chamic languages, and [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) suggest a native word.  The attested distribution leaves serious doubt as to whether &ast;_qiaŋ_ should be assigned to [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094), but if borrowing is not responsible for the forms in [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) and the Chamic languages it must have an antiquity of at least three thousand years.",

[PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_qiCeluR_ evidently referred to the eggs of most oviparous fauna, including insects, amphibians, reptiles and birds, but not to fish roe (&ast;_biaS_).  So far as the available evidence permits us to infer, &ast;_qiteluR manuk_ referred to the eggs both of birds and of chickens, though ‘chicken egg’ clearly was the unmarked sense.  Finally, semantically corresponding expressions formed from the same free morphemes such as [Sangir](LanguageTable#cldf:402) _manuʔ me-te-telluheʔ_ ‘laying hen’, [Kambera](LanguageTable#cldf:678) _manu tílu_ ‘laying hen’ suggest a [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) collocation for ‘laying hen’.

The presence of morphologically complex reflexes of &ast;_qipil_ in [Samoan](LanguageTable#cldf:401) may have been motivated by the merger of [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_qipil_ ‘Intsia bijuga’ and [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_ipi_ ‘_Inocarpus fagiferus_’ as pre-Samoan &ast;_ifi_.",milner1966

The evidence for &ast;_maŋ-qitem_ presented here falls into two clusters: the reflexes in [Kadazan Dusun](LanguageTable#cldf:287) and [Nias](LanguageTable#cldf:361), which are essentially causative (and hence require an object) and the rest, which are inchoative (and hence require only a patient).

The remaining forms which are of common origin are confined to western Indonesia (including Sulawesi) and the southern Philippines.  A number of these appear to be loanwords from [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) (e.g. [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) _itoŋ_ ‘count, tally, sum; abacus’, [Kelabit](LanguageTable#cldf:299) _ituŋ_ ‘a figure, act of counting’, _ŋ-ituŋ_ ‘to count’, [Buginese](LanguageTable#cldf:239) _ituŋ_ ‘count’).  However, the agreement of widespread languages ([Tiruray](LanguageTable#cldf:433), [Kadazan Dusun](LanguageTable#cldf:287), [Kayan](LanguageTable#cldf:294), [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660), [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325)) in reflecting a meaning ‘to think, think about, consider’ cannot easily be explained as a product of borrowing from [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), since this meaning is not historically attested with a reflex of &ast;_qituŋ_ in any known [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) dialect.  Moreover, since [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081), [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) &ast;_ihap_ clearly meant ‘to count’, and since no good [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) competitor is available for the meaning ‘to think’, it appears best to assign the latter meaning to &ast;_qituŋ_.",dempwolff193438

His inclusion of [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) _harimauŋ_ in this comparison is dubious, and in any case all of the forms cited are found in western Indonesia.

The rattan is an important source of stronger binding material (as for house construction) in many parts of the Austronesian-speaking world.  Reflexes of &ast;_quay_ generally refer to _Calamus_ species, but may refer as well to whips made of rattan, a secondary meaning attributable to [PCMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076) &ast;_quay_ (cf. reflexes in [Ngadha](LanguageTable#cldf:357), [Rotinese](LanguageTable#cldf:395) and [Buruese](LanguageTable#cldf:251)).  Finally, the reconstruction of &ast;_maŋ-quay_ and &ast;_paŋ-quay_ takes liberties with the comparative method: more generally, &ast;_maŋ-_ is an active verb prefix and &ast;_paŋ-_ a marker of nominal agency.

One of the basic [MP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) root crops, the yam was carried by Austronesian speakers from island Southeast Asia into the Pacific as far east as Hawaii. No reflexes of &ast;_qubi_ have yet been found in Taiwan, and there is consequently no linguistic evidence that the plant was domesticated by Austronesian speakers prior to [MP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) times.  


The thematic consonant in [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) _ubih-an_ ‘yam patch’ indicates an etymon &ast;_qubih_, but this is contradicted by [Itbayaten](LanguageTable#cldf:282) _ovi_ ‘yam’.  Finally, reflexes of &ast;_qubi_ have been extended to several tuberous plants of South American origin which were introduced into Southeast Asia by the Portuguese and Spanish.  These include the sweet potato, _Ipomoea batatas_, and the manioc, cassava or tapioca, _Manihot utilissima_.  


The collocation &ast;_qubi kahiw_ can be reconstructed with the meaning ‘cassava’, although there is no evidence that cassava was known in [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) times.  There appear to be three possible explanations for this contradiction: 1. reflexes of &ast;_qubi kahiw_ are borrowings from [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), 2. a collocation &ast;_qubi kahiw_ was found in [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094), but had some other meaning (e.g. ‘type of yam’) which was systematically replaced by the meaning ‘cassava’ once the later was introduced, and 3. the collocation itself is a product of convergent innovation after the introduction of cassava, much like the widespread Algonkian cognates meaning ‘gun’ and ‘whiskey’ ([Bloomfield 1946](Source#cldf:bloomfield1946)).",bloomfield1946

[Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) posited &ast;_qutan_ ‘Wald’ ( = ‘woods, forest’).  However, reflexes of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_halas_ almost invariably mean ‘forest’, while reflexes of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_qutan_ cover a wide range of referents, including at least ‘vegetable’ ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) + [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076)), ‘weed’ ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) + [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082)), ‘forest’ ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) + [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076) + [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082)), ‘wild’ ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) + [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076)) and bean ([WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) + [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076)).  This striking difference in ""semantic profile"" ([Blust 1987](Source#cldf:blust1987)) clearly favors the reconstruction of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_alas_ with the meaning ‘forest’, but it does not mechanically provide us with a gloss for [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_qutan_.  To gloss the latter we must consider both the range of its semantic reflexes and its relationship to other [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) terms, such as &ast;_alas_. 



At first sight there is little apparent connection between such meanings as ‘vegetable’ and ‘forest’, and we might therefore treat the reflexes of &ast;_qutan_ which cluster about each of these meanings as belonging to different cognate sets.  Apart from the problems of synonymy already mentioned in connection with &ast;_alas_, what makes it difficult to segregate these semantic clusters under two homophonous [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) reconstructions, &ast;_qutan_₁ and &ast;_qutan_₂, is the presence of forms which provide a clear semantic bridge between them. First, the meanings ‘vegetable’ and ‘wild’ can be reconciled through a hypothesis that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_qutan_ referred to wild vegetables, a meaning that is actually reflected in [Alune](LanguageTable#cldf:471) _utane_.  Second, the semantic reflex ‘weed’ (and the similar meaning ‘grass’ in [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) and [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372)) can be explained by modifying our hypothesis to state that &ast;_qutan_ referred to small, wild herbaceous plants whether they were edible/useful or not.  Third, the meaning ‘bean’ can be included as an implicit component of our reconstructed gloss by hypothesizing that leguminous plants constituted an important part of the total inventory of small, wild herbaceous plants known to speakers of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081). Finally, the meaning ‘forest’ can be added under the assumption that &ast;_qutan_ referred both to a type of vegetation and to the type of land on which it grew. 



 The difficulty of glossing [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_quCaN_ stems from the paucity of known [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) reflexes.  For [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_qutan_ this problem does not exist; rather, it is difficult to arrive at an adequate gloss because there appears to be no single convenient English lexical category which corresponds to the [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) concept.  If we gloss &ast;_qutan_ as ‘small, wild herbaceous plants; scrub-land, bush’ we will perhaps come close to the sense of the [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) term.  A meaning very similar to the first half of this gloss is reflected in [Ngadha](LanguageTable#cldf:357) _uta_ ‘underbrush, scrub, low-growing plants’ and [Lakalai](LanguageTable#cldf:877) _la-huta-huta_ ‘general term for small plants and leaves’.  Apart from its additional reference to type of land the meaning of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_qutan_ is essentially identical to what [Brown (1984:13)](Source#cldf:brown1984) has called _grerb_: ""Small plant (relative to the plant inventory of a particular environment) whose parts are chiefly herbaceous (green, leafy, nonwoody)."" 



The basic correctness of this interpretation is strikingly confirmed by a secondary meaning of [Lakalai](LanguageTable#cldf:877) _la-huta-huta_, ‘trash’, since [Brown (1984:62)](Source#cldf:brown1984) has argued that ""terms for _grerb_ in both Polynesian and Mayan languages have developed from words for rubbish, garbage, trash, litter, rotten stuff, and the like.  In most cases such words were first extended to weeds, i.e., useless and bothersome small herbaceous plants, and then through expansion of reference to small herbaceous plants in general.""  However, in the present case there can be no doubt that the semantic development in [Lakalai](LanguageTable#cldf:877) _la-huta-huta_ has been from ‘_grerb_’ to ‘trash’ rather than the reverse.  Finally, it is notable that in [Southeast Ambrym](LanguageTable#cldf:996) the reflex of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_qutan_ acquired a sense very similar to that associated with reflexes of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_banua_ ‘inhabited territory’ in other [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) languages, and like some of these came to mean ‘weather’, thus providing another example of what I have elsewhere called a ‘semantic cycle’ in historical change ([Blust 1989b](Source#cldf:blust1989)).",dempwolff193438;blust1987;brown1984[13];brown1984[62];blust1989

[Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) reconstructed &ast;_qudip_ ‘to live’, and although this semantic reconstruction is justified, it appears incomplete in a number of respects due to differences in the ""conceptual focus"" ([Blust 1991a](Source#cldf:blust1991)) of the German/English and  Austronesian terms.  Whereas English ‘living, alive’ denotes merely the presence of life processes, [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_qudip_ evidently denoted a dominance of vitality as manifested in growth, flourishing, and being healthy, fresh (of plants), or green (of plants, wood). 


 Reflexes in [MP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) languages show recurrent references to vegetation and to growth, a component of the meaning which is reinforced by the observation that &ast;_qudip_ has been replaced in a number of the languages of Sulawesi by reflexes of &ast;_tumbuq_ ‘to grow’.  If anything in English reminds us of this conceptual focus it is perhaps the depiction of the life-force in Dylan Thomas, ‘The force that through the green fuse drives the flower’ (‘Drives my green age ... ‘).  


Extensions of this primary sense are seen in [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:19083) &ast;_qudip_ 'mend, repair' ([Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) and [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331)), recurrent references to newness ([Ngadha](LanguageTable#cldf:357) and ['Āre'āre](LanguageTable#cldf:18004)), the new moon ([Rotinese](LanguageTable#cldf:395), [Maori](LanguageTable#cldf:330), [Hawaiian](LanguageTable#cldf:620)), and birth ([Tetun](LanguageTable#cldf:1060), [Sa'a](LanguageTable#cldf:18945)) and perhaps the soul, where the vital principle is seen as essentially supernatural ([Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285), [Lonwolwol](LanguageTable#cldf:320), [Rennellese](LanguageTable#cldf:390), [Anuta](LanguageTable#cldf:229), [Rarotongan](LanguageTable#cldf:388), [Nukuoro](LanguageTable#cldf:363)), and so applied to body parts that have well-known associations with the exit and entry of the soul ([Rennellese](LanguageTable#cldf:390): skull, fontanel, [Hawaiian](LanguageTable#cldf:620): fontanel).  [Mota](LanguageTable#cldf:344) _maur_! ‘cry to a child that sneezes’ and [Tuvaluan](LanguageTable#cldf:19417) _ma-uli_ ‘a sneeze; to sneeze’ undoubtedly derive from formulaic expressions wishing health or protection from the loss of the soul [Tylor (1958 [1871]:1:97ff)](bib-Tylor).  

Although this is substantially similar to traditional European beliefs, the different emphasis of the Austronesian term in comparison with the English term is seen again in the recurrent references to healing, curing, reviving and recovering (where the life-force is reasserting not merely its presence, but its dominance).  A metaphorical extension of the notion of healing or riviving is seen in [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) _údip_ ‘mend, patch (mats, baskets, etc.)’, [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) _orip_ ‘reweave, patch up, repair a mat’ (hence [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:19083) &ast;_qudip_ ‘patch a mat’).  


Finally, there are difficult questions with some features of the morphology of this form.  I assume that the similar infixation in [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660) _h-um-urip_ and such [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) forms as [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) _q-m-uzi-quzip_ is a product of convergence, and that despite the widespread loss of morpheme boundary in [CEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19074) reflexes of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_ma-qudip_, [PCEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19074) must have had &ast;_ma-qudip_ (not &ast;_maqudip_), since [Sa'a](LanguageTable#cldf:18945) _haʔa-uri_ appears to be a straightforward reflex of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_paka-qudip_.",dempwolff193438;blust1991

The antiquity of smoking in the Austronesian world is unclear.  Tobacco could not have been introduced prior to Portuguese contact in the 16th century, and the smoking of opium probably was introduced by southern Chinese no earlier than the Ming dynasty (1368-1644 A.D.), at which time a loanword for ‘smoking pipe’ (_hunsuy_, etc.) entered many of the Austronesian languages of Taiwan, the Philippines and western Indonesia.  If &ast;_qudud_ was present in [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) it probably meant ‘to suck’.",

30278,*qulas,q,dewdrop,,
27859,*qulej,q,type of small worm,"Also [Amis](LanguageTable#cldf:227) _ʔoner_ ‘snake’, [Casiguran Dumagat](LanguageTable#cldf:569) _uhéd_ ‘caterpillar, generic for any larva which will turn into a flying insect’, [Simalur](LanguageTable#cldf:415) _ulag_, _ulaʔ_ ‘caterpillar, maggot; blowfly’, [Nias](LanguageTable#cldf:361) _ulo-ulo_ ‘maggots’, [Sundanese](LanguageTable#cldf:418) _hileud_ ‘caterpillar, maggot, grub’, [Rennellese](LanguageTable#cldf:390) _ugo_ ‘maggot, as found in dead matter’, [Kapingamarangi](LanguageTable#cldf:292) _ila_ ‘maggot’.  


The irregular vowel change in [Sundanese](LanguageTable#cldf:418) _hileud_ is assumed to be independent of that in the Polynesian languages, but for the latter it is simplest to assume a single innovation (hence PPn &ast;_ʔilo_).  Since the reduplicated forms of &ast;_qulej_ show little semantic agreement the doubling of this stem may have occurred independently in various languages.  Nonetheless, in view of the inescapably collective character of the referent and the common use of reduplication in Austronesian languages to indicate plurality or intensity, I tentatively reconstruct [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_qulej qulej_ as a collective or intensive form (‘lots of worms’, ‘crawling with worms, extremely wormy’).  


Perhaps the most challenging feature of this comparison is its meaning.  On present evidence all that can safely be reconstructed for [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) is the meaning ‘maggot’.  It is clear that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) retained this meaning, but added the referent ‘caterpillar’.  [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_qulej_ thus meant essentially ‘larva of a flying insect’.  This meaning persisted in [PCEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19074) and Proto-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, but [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) evidently innovated &ast;_muno_ in the meaning ‘caterpillar’, thus once again restricting the referent of the present form to ‘maggot’.  Most problematic is the evidence from [Puyuma](LanguageTable#cldf:386), [Manobo (Western Bukidnon)](LanguageTable#cldf:819) and [Tboli](LanguageTable#cldf:19175) that [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) _&ast;qulej_ meant not only ‘maggot’, but also ‘insect’.  [Brown (1984)](Source#cldf:brown1984) has argued that generic labels for an insect ( = ‘wug’) lexical category develop late in the history of languages, and it seems likely that the sparse and scattered agreements cited here are convergent.  


Finally, the specific agreement of [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) _ulud-úlud_ and [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432) _olitra_ in referring to tooth decay suggests a [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) belief that dental caries are caused by a burrowing worm in the tooth.",brown1984

The [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) forms, on the other hand, may show only a chance resemblance to this cognate set.",

The reconstruction of final &ast;_h_ in this form has resulted from comments received from Laurent Sagart. Although only the meaning ‘head’ can be assigned to [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_quluh_, [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_qulu_ clearly had a number of meanings in addition to its primary use as a body-part label. Physical extensions of this primary sense include applications to the tops of trees, mountains and the like, and to the handles of bladed implements such as knives and axes. 



Somewhat more striking are widespread reflexes of &ast;_qulu_ in the meaning ‘headwaters of a river’, probably in the construction _&ast;qulu ni wahiR_. Figurative extensions include the meaning ‘leader, chief’. In [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) this meaning is associated with the prefixed form _&ast;paŋ-qulu_; in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) the same meaning can be associated only with the unaffixed base. As in English _overhead_ and _ahead_, reflexes of &ast;_qulu_ apply not only to the upper part of objects, but also to the front part of objects (‘prow of a boat’) and to priority in time (‘first’, ‘first-born’). Last of all, in a number of [CEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19074) languages extending from [Rotinese](LanguageTable#cldf:395) in the west to [Samoan](LanguageTable#cldf:401) in the east, a reflex of &ast;_qulu_ refers (among other things) to the hair of the head.",

It is tempting to consider [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372) _chum_ as a loan from an [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) language for the following reasons: 1. it is the only reflex of &ast;_qumun_ yet reported in any non-[CEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19074) language, 2. it appears to show an irregular loss of the last consonant.  The difficulty with this hypotheses is that no [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) language which preserves &ast;_q-_ as a glottal stop is available as a likely source for the [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372) word.  


Moreover, [McManus and Josephs (1977)](bib-McManus) list no less than six forms under _meŋum_: 1. _meŋúm_ ‘bake (food) in a hole in the ground’, 2. _chumíi_, 3. _chum_, 4. _chilumíi_, 5. _chilúm_, 6. _klum_ ‘hole in the ground for baking’.  The second and fourth of these may be interpreted as reflecting a doublet &ast;_qumul_ (distinct from [Dobuan](LanguageTable#cldf:258) _ʔumura_, [Molima](LanguageTable#cldf:18975) _ʔumula_, which reflect earlier &ast;_qumur_).  Alternatively, we might argue that under certain conditions final nasals normally were lost in [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372); other examples that might be cited are &ast;_qumaŋ_ ‘hermit crab’ > _chum_ ‘kind of snail’ and perhaps  &ast;_ijuŋ_ > _íis_ ‘nose’.  It is simplest, then, to treat [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372) _chum_ as a native form.  However, in so doing we are forced to conclude that &ast;_qumun_ (and evidently the use of the earth oven) disappeared in all other [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094)-speaking societies.  Given the predominantly [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) character of Palauan culture this presents us with a remarkable apparent coincidence: that a [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) reflex of &ast;_qumun_ was retained only in that [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094)-speaking society which most closely approximates the general [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) culture type.",

The initial syllable of [Thao](LanguageTable#cldf:1062) _qaqutilh_ is part of the base, and cannot be explained by the reconstruction given here.  It is assumed to be a due to fossilized _Ca-_ reduplication. Several of the Northern Philippine forms with irregular &ast;_R_ > /_g_/ and a basically metaphorical gloss (‘investigate’) appear to be loans from [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279).",
27903,*qusuŋ,q,carry between two persons,"The essential meaning of this term in most known [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) witnesses is ‘to transport jointly’.  [Motu](LanguageTable#cldf:345) _udu-a_ reflects a different meaning, but due to gaps in attestation it is unclear whether this semantic innovation is unique to [Motu](LanguageTable#cldf:345) (and perhaps its close releatives), or one which took place in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082).  


However, since [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_papa_ ([PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_baba_) can be reconstructed in the meaning ‘carry a person pick-a-back; ride pick-a-back’, it appears likely that [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_usuŋ_ had some other meaning.  I assume, then, that the semantic innovation in [Motu](LanguageTable#cldf:345) did not take place in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082), and that its agreement with [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245) _untuŋ_ ‘carry on the neck, as a child’ is a product of convergence.  Finally, the exact meaning of &ast;_usuŋ-an_ is unclear, although the word evidently was serviceable in referring to any routinely used or improvised device for jointly transporting a load normally regarded as too heavy for one person to carry.",

27898,*quSeNap,q,fish scale,"Also [Tausug](LanguageTable#cldf:18831) _huʔnap_ ‘fish scales’, [Manobo (Western Bukidnon)](LanguageTable#cldf:819) _hunʔap_ ‘scales of a fish’, [Bintulu](LanguageTable#cldf:242) _nap_ ‘fish scale’, [Tontemboan](LanguageTable#cldf:19052) _urap_ ‘scales’, [Gitua](LanguageTable#cldf:270) _anap_ ‘scales’, [Lau](LanguageTable#cldf:313) _unafa_ ‘to scale fish’, _unafa-na_ ‘fish scales’, [Lau](LanguageTable#cldf:313) _unufa_ ‘to scale fish’, _unufa-na_ ‘fish scales’, [Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434) _ʔuno_ ‘scales (of fish), shell (of turtle)’, _ʔuno ʔuno ʔi ika_ ‘fish scales’, [Anuta](LanguageTable#cldf:229) _uno_ ‘fish scales’.  [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_qunap_ probably referred not only to fish scales, but also to the scales of snakes and the scales on the legs of fowls.  


The semantic extension to ‘turtle shell’ is attested to date only from the Moluccas, southeast Solomons and Polynesia, and is tentatively attributed to [PCEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19074). A number of MIC languages reflect &ast;_qunap_ not only with the meaning ‘scale’, but also with the meanings ‘feathers’, ‘hair’ and ‘fur’ (viz. any natural body covering).  This semantic innovation, which is attested in at least [Kosraean](LanguageTable#cldf:713), Ponapeic and Trukic, apparently originated in [Proto-Micronesian](LanguageTable#cldf:19079).",

The appearance of a mid-vowel in many of the reflexes cited here is unexplained.


Part of this comparison is drawn from [Tsuchida (1976:171)](Source#cldf:tsuchida1976).  There are problems with the medial consonant, which Tsuchida reconstructs as &ast;_S₂_ to explain the zero reflex for expected /_s_/ in [Tsou](LanguageTable#cldf:1087), [Rukai](LanguageTable#cldf:397) and [Bunun](LanguageTable#cldf:250).  The evidence for a medial sibilant therefore depends entirely on Central Philippine languages in which /_h_/ normally reflects &ast;_S_ (very rarely &ast;_h_).",tsuchida1976[171]
27905,*qutaŋ,q,debt,"Also [Itbayaten](LanguageTable#cldf:282) _ootaŋ_ ‘debt, obligation’, [Kalamian Tagbanwa](LanguageTable#cldf:18285) _utaŋ_ ‘debt’, [Tboli](LanguageTable#cldf:19175) _utoŋ_ ‘credit’, _m-utoŋ_ ‘give credit’.  Despite the abundant supporting evidence which I have cited, this item remains in certain respects highly problematic.  In a number of the languages of the northern Philippines it is explicitly marked as a loan from [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) or [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279), and in a number of the languages of Indonesia it is explicitly marked as a loan from [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326). 


These explicit lexicographic statements (which presumably reflect native speaker reactions) are further strengthened by phonological irregularities in such languages as [Kalamian Tagbanwa](LanguageTable#cldf:18285) and [Tboli](LanguageTable#cldf:19175), and by the fact that this word refers most commonly to the borrowing of _money_ rather than of objects to be returned either themselves or in kind.  


On the other hand, the word is richly attested in the Philippines and western Indonesia, and a number of apparently non-borrowed affixed forms can be reconstructed for [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094).  Based on the evidence now available I see no choice but to accept &ast;_qutaŋ_ as native (perhaps only to certain [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) languages), although its precise meaning remains to be determined.",

[Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) reconstructed &ast;_uti_ ‘penis’, but based his reconstruction solely on [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) _uti_, [Fijian](LanguageTable#cldf:266) _uti-_ ‘penis’. [Fijian](LanguageTable#cldf:266) has lost original final consonants, and [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) _uti_, like the similar form in [Bontok](LanguageTable#cldf:246), [Kayan](LanguageTable#cldf:294) and [Lauje](LanguageTable#cldf:726), shows reanalysis of earlier _utin-na_ to _uti-na_ ‘his penis’, _uti_ ‘penis’.  


In [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325) the reflexes of &ast;_qutiN_ ‘penis’ and &ast;_utiŋ_ ‘pin at the base of a blade which fits into the hilt to bind the two together’ have come to be homophonous.  As a consequence _otiŋ_ from &ast;_qutiN_ has been reinterpreted in folk etymology as a metaphorical extension of _otiŋ_ from &ast;_utiŋ_ (cp. the similar extension in [Kayan](LanguageTable#cldf:294)), hence the humorous connotations reported by [Cense (1979)](Source#cldf:cense1979).  Finally, the double meaning of [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) _otin_, together with [Arosi](LanguageTable#cldf:485) _wi_ ‘prefix to the names of men’, _wii_ ‘penis’ and parallel usages with other morphemes (e.g. [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947) _laso_ ‘penis’, _lasoʔ_ ‘boy’) suggests that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_qutin_ may also have been used in certain speech registers as a term of reference or address for men and boys.",dempwolff193438;cense1979

Nonetheless, at least [Manobo (Western Bukidnon)](LanguageTable#cldf:819) _uyag_ and [Tboli](LanguageTable#cldf:19175) _kuyag_ appear to be non-borrowed cognates which occur in members of different first-order subgroups of the Philippine languages.",

Although a future verbal sense is indicated both by [Ifugaw](LanguageTable#cldf:636) and by [Hanunóo](LanguageTable#cldf:273), it is likely that &ast;_q-um-uzaN_ functioned both as the verb ‘to rain’ and as the (subjectless) sentential comment ‘it is raining’. As is often the case in derived reduplications with only generic semantic similarity, the evidence for [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_quzan quzan_ may be a product of convergence. 


 The most striking of the morphologically complex units built around &ast;_quzan_ undoubtedly is [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_quzan batu_ ‘hail’, as it implies a continuous familiarity with hailstorms throughout the millennia-long migrations of the [Malayo-Polynesian](LanguageTable#cldf:19081)-speaking peoples.  This is surprising, as many of the reflexes are found not in the more northerly languages of Taiwan  and the _Philippines_ , but rather in languages that are spoken very near the Equator, and in some cases close to sea level.  Perhaps the agreement of [Rennellese](LanguageTable#cldf:390) _ʔua hatu_ with similar forms in [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) languages is also a product of convergence, since the collocation ‘stone rain’ is semantically transparent, and could easily be invented independently (cp. [Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434) _ʔuha maka_ (lit. ""stone rain"") = ‘hail’, where, however, _maka_ may be a lexical replacement of earlier _fatu_). Finally, although the mutually corroboratory irregularity in the Batak languages and [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660) and Modern [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285) in reflecting /_d_/ rather than /_j_/ in this form has been noted both by [van der Tuuk (1971)](bib-van) and by [Dyen (1951)](Source#cldf:dyen1951), the evidence for a distinct phoneme &ast;_Z_ is in fact internally contradictory, and is disregarded here.",dyen1951

In a few cases (e.g. [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432) _órona_, [Fijian](LanguageTable#cldf:266) _ucu_) it is conceivable that the reflex I have assigned to &ast;_quzuŋ_ actually belongs with &ast;_ujuŋ_ ‘nose’.

However, this word is attested in a number of other languages of the Admiralty Islands, including [Likum](LanguageTable#cldf:319) on the southwest coast, [Mondropolon](LanguageTable#cldf:854) on the north-central coast, [Leipon](LanguageTable#cldf:730) on a separate island off the northeast coast, and [Nauna](LanguageTable#cldf:355), located some distance from Manus in the southeastern Admiralties.  The gloss given for the [Nauna](LanguageTable#cldf:355) form, together with cover terms for ‘whale, dolphin’ in [Mokilese](LanguageTable#cldf:342) and [Puluwat](LanguageTable#cldf:385) indicate that &ast;_rato_ probably referred to one of the smaller common whales, perhaps the pilot whale.  



In collecting data from these languages during linguistic fieldwork in 1975 I distinguished whales from dolphins, but did not distinguish types of whales unless this information was spontaneously volunteered.  The most commonly elicited form for ‘whale’ was a reflex of Proto-Eastern Admiralty &ast;_moluam_, but this term designates the largest (and hence psychologically most salient) cetacean, and if a concerted effort had been made to elicit terms for different types of whales I have no doubt that reflexes of [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_rato_ designating the smaller whale found in the Admiralties would have been much more frequent.",osmond2011

Both variants appear in [Amis](LanguageTable#cldf:227), where [Fey (1986)](Source#cldf:fey1986) gives _lafi_ ‘dinner, the evening meal’, but _lafii_ ‘midnight’, and several languages that should have a non-zero reflex of &ast;_q_ instead show no intervocalic consonant, as with [Atayal](LanguageTable#cldf:493) _gbi-an_ ‘late afternoon, evening’, [Agutaynen](LanguageTable#cldf:19189) _labi_ ‘night’, [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) _gabi_ ‘meal at evening’, [Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434) _efi-afi_ and [Rennellese](LanguageTable#cldf:390) _ahi-ahi_ ‘afternoon, early evening’.

The [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) status of this reconstruction depends crucially on [Hoanya](LanguageTable#cldf:626) _matala-gasut_, recorded by Naoyoshi Ogawa from a 75-year old male in 1909 ([Tsuchida 1982:40](Source#cldf:tsuchida1982)).  However, this form is problem-free, since &ast;_R_ > _g_ is independently attested in &ast;_um-aRi_ > _magi_ ‘come’, &ast;_C_ > _s_ in &ast;_Caliŋa_ > _saŋila_ ‘ear’ or &ast;_CebuS_ > _sibus_ ‘sugarcane’, and &ast;_s_ > _t_ in &ast;_susu_ > _tutu_ ‘female breast’.  Unlike such Northern Luzon forms as [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) _gasút_ or north Sulawesi forms as [Sangir](LanguageTable#cldf:402) _se-hasuʔ_, then, the [Hoanya](LanguageTable#cldf:626) form does not show metathesis in relation to [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_Ratus_. In fact, if [Hoanya](LanguageTable#cldf:626) reflected &ast;_RasuC_ its expected reflex for ‘one hundred’ would be &ast;&ast;_(matala-)gatus_, and so would appear to agree with unmetathesized reflexes of the [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) form.  Both [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) and [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) reconstructions for this form thus appear to be firmly established, with consonants in the order reflected by the great majority of the languages.",tsuchida1982[40]

The &ast;_Rakit_ probably was made of bamboo, which is highly buoyant, and difficult to sink or become waterlogged.  Although cognates are unknown in Taiwan, it is likely that Austronesian speakers reached Taiwan from the mainland of southern China (Fujian) by means of bamboo rafts, since there is no evidence for the outrigger canoe prior to [Proto-Malayo-Polynesian](LanguageTable#cldf:19081).  Rafts continued to be useful for purposes of short water crossings, long after outrigger canoes had become the primary means of long-distance oversea exploration.  Their function probably was primarily to ferry people and goods across large rivers or short water crossings.  For this reason rafts were retained in places like Mindanao or Borneo, where there were many rivers to cross, but lost in places like the Marianas, Micronesia or Polynesia, where open water crossings required more sophisticated watercraft.

Nonetheless, both &ast;_Rambia_ and &ast;_Rumbia_ appear to be justified by comparative evidence.

Based on [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _libo_, [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) _ribu_, [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285) _ewu_, [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) _ribu_, [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432) _a-rivu_ ‘thousand’ [Dempwolff (1938)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) posited &ast;_ribu_ ‘thousand’.  However, this reconstruction was problematic from the start, since the [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423), [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) and [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432) words are almost certain loans from [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326).  As the matter is pursued in greater depth with more languages the history of this word becomes even more perplexing, as nearly all reflexes in both the Philippines and Indonesia appear to be [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) loans, yet a few languages have forms that cannot be explained in this way, pointing instead to &ast;_Ribu_. This is clearly true of [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) in the southern Philippines, and of the Berawan languages in Sarawak, both of which reflect [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_R_ as _g_ in this word.  It also appears to be true of the [Kenyah](LanguageTable#cldf:300) dialects (including [Penan](LanguageTable#cldf:18658)), which normally lose &ast;_R_ word-initially.  Many other forms are ambiguous: e.g. is [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) _ríbo_ ‘thousand’ native, or is it a [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) loanword that has acquired native affixation in the form _sa-ŋa-ríbo_ ‘one thousand’?  All in all it seems best to assume that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) had a word &ast;_Ribu_ ‘thousand’ that was lost or replaced in Proto-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, but preserved in many languages of western Indonesia and the Philippines, only to be replaced in time by [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _ribu_, presumably as a consequence of the dominant role of [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) in pan-archipelagic trade over the past two millennia.  In this respect it stands in sharp contrast to reflexes of &ast;_Ratus_ ‘hundred’, which appear to be native in most languages, including those that have an apparently borrowed form of &ast;_Ribu_.",dempwolff193438

However, [Kanakanabu](LanguageTable#cldf:680) _uma-iriki_, like [Puyuma (Tamalakaw)](LanguageTable#cldf:18964) _iRik_ ‘thresh with the feet’ is most simply derived from &ast;_iRik_, and [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _(h)irek_ from &ast;_qiRik_.

The history of irrigated rice in the Austronesian world remains unclear.  While evidence of rice agriculture at the time of the initial Austronesian settlement of Taiwan is abundant in both the long-established linguistic record and in the much more recent, but key archaeological site of Nankuangli East at the Science-based Industrial Park in Tainan, all that either line of evidence unambigously supports is swidden rice.  

The present comparison (based just on [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427), [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285), [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) _manawan_ ‘to harvest’, and [Fijian](LanguageTable#cldf:266) _cava_ ‘harvest time’), was first proposed by [Dempwolff (1938)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438).

It seems clear that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_sakit_ referred both to sickness and to pain, without a clear distinction.

In addition, specific but variable collocations (‘monthly sickness’, ‘woman’s sickness’, ‘unclean sickness’) in various languages show that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_sakit_ probably figured in expressions meaning ‘menstruation’.  With regard to geographical distribution it is odd that this cognate set almost completely skips eastern Indonesia (attested here only in [Kowiai/Koiwai](LanguageTable#cldf:304) _sait noʔo i_ ‘to be taken ill’), and is very rare in the western Pacific, although it is common in the Southeast Solomons, Micronesia, parts of Vanuatu, and Polynesia.

The longer word almost certainly contains [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_layaR_ ([Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434), [Niue](LanguageTable#cldf:362),  [Samoan](LanguageTable#cldf:401) _lā_) ‘sail’.

Vowel syncope left an unstable medial cluster _–ŋl-_, and languages coped with this in various ways.  In the Philippines many languages assimilated the nasal to the place of the liquid, producing _–nl-_ either as the only form ([Hiligaynon](LanguageTable#cldf:623), [Waray-Waray](LanguageTable#cldf:19275), [Masbatenyo](LanguageTable#cldf:19186), [Binukid](LanguageTable#cldf:19012)) or as a variant of _–ŋl-_ ([Bikol](LanguageTable#cldf:244)).  As a further step, in languages such as [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331), [Manobo (Western Bukidnon)](LanguageTable#cldf:819), or [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245), the liquid was replaced by _d_, thus conforming to the high frequency pattern of medial homorganically prenasalized stops.  A similar strategy in languages of northern Sumatra and south Sulawesi preserved the velar nasal and assimilated the liquid to it as a voiced velar stop, as in [Simalur](LanguageTable#cldf:415) _saŋgal_ or [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325) _saŋgaraʔ_.  [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _saŋág_ may show cluster simplification, although it is just as likely that the loss of the liquid in this form is part of the larger pattern in which some instances of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_l_ became _h_ or disappeared.  [Minangkabau](LanguageTable#cldf:337) _salar_ and [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _selar_ show cluster reduction by deletion of the first consonant (except in the [Minangkabau](LanguageTable#cldf:337) variant saŋlar), and forms in CMP languages show cluster reduction by deletion of the second consonant. 


Malay and CMP languages appear to have undergone prepenultimate vowel neutralization to schwa while this word was still trisyllabic: _&ast;saŋelaR_ ([_saŋəlar_]) > _səŋəlaR_ > _səŋlaR_ > _səlaR_ > [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _səlar_ (and presumably [Minangkabau](LanguageTable#cldf:337) _salar_, with regular &ast;_ə_ > _a_); &ast;_saŋelaR_ ([_saŋəlar_]) > _səŋəlaR_ > _səŋlaR_ > _səŋaR_ > _sənaR_ > _sonaR_ > [Rotinese](LanguageTable#cldf:395) _sena_, [Tetun](LanguageTable#cldf:1060) _sona_, etc.  The final vowel of [Lamaholot](LanguageTable#cldf:19031) _səŋeʔ_ is evidently irregular, although the precise history of this form is unclear. 


 Finally, the meaning of this form does not seem to correspond exactly to any English term, as it refers to cooking in a frying pan without oil by rapidly stirring the contents to prevent burning, much as in stir-frying with a Chinese wok.",

This is one of the few body part terms from which verbs are derived, and affixed forms such as &ast;_siku_ suggest that the meaning ‘to elbow’ coexisted alongside the noun.

There is no doubt that this term referred to the west monsoon of island Southeast Asia and portions of western Melanesia, in contradistinction to the east monsoon, &ast;_timuR_ (q.v.).  Apart from a few anomalous glosses ([Kavalan](LanguageTable#cldf:293) _balat_, [Manobo (Western Bukidnon)](LanguageTable#cldf:819) _evaǥat_) the references to cardinal directions in the reflexes are consistent with a west wind centered very near the Equator.  In Amis (23 degrees n. latitude) this is described as a ‘south’ wind, throughout most of the Philippines (5-18 degrees n. latitude) it is described as a ‘south’ or ‘southwest’ wind, in most of the languages of Indonesia (5 degrees n. latitude to 10 degrees s. latitude) it is described as a ‘west’ wind, and in Merina, the standard dialect of Malagasy (23 degrees s. latitude) the meaning is ‘north’ (presumably a secondary semantic development after the Malagasy migration from southeast Borneo). 


 In the western Pacific the orientation of the west monsoon to the north-south axis appears to be somewhat different.  The languages of the Admiralty Islands (all within 2 degrees s. latitude) and a number of those in southeastern Papua (roughly 10 degrees s. latitude) refer to the west monsoon as a ‘northwest’ wind, whereas the languages of both western and eastern Indonesia at corresponding latitudes refer to it as a ‘west’ wind.

Although this term is glossed ‘to paddle’ in some dictionaries, it is clear that &ast;_paluja_ had that meaning in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072), and retained it in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082), forcing us to conclude that Proto-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian carried some other sense.  


It is likely that ‘to walk backward’ is a secondary development from the meaning ‘to backpaddle’, since retrograde motion in walking has no practical or cultural significance, whereas backpaddling is needed for turning a canoe around when a change of direction is desired.  The meaning ‘to tack’ appears to be an innovation in [Proto-Polynesian](LanguageTable#cldf:19084) that was borrowed into [Rotuman](LanguageTable#cldf:394), with tacking possibly linked to the notion of retrograde motion, or at least the absence of forward motion in sailing.

This term documents a cultural practice that was traditionally widespread both in the Austronesian world and in mainland Southeast Asia, namely the use of sharpened bamboo spikes that were placed, point up, on trails, around protected property, or in concealed pit traps, either to injure enemies in warfare or to catch pigs or other wild animals for food.

The relationship between [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:19083) &ast;_utaq_ ‘to vomit’ and this term is unclear.  Although it is tempting to assume that &ast;_suka_ replaced the much more widespread &ast;_utaq_ in a restricted Philippine subgroup, this is disfavored for two reasons: 1. the Sangiric languages appear to form a primary branch of the Philippine group, and 2. [Sneddon (1984:106)](Source#cldf:sneddon1984) indicates that the Sangiric languages which reflect &ast;_suka_ are [Bantik](LanguageTable#cldf:520) and Ratahan/Toratan, not the more northerly [Sangir](LanguageTable#cldf:402). Alternatively, it might be assumed that these terms coexisted in [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:19083) with a still undetected distinction of meaning.  However, both are glossed simply ‘vomit; to vomit’ in the primary sources.  Further complicating matters, although both terms occur in the southern Phiilippines, no language is known to reflect more than one (which might provide a clue to an original semantic contrast).",sneddon1984[106]

Somewhat confusingly, [Dempwolff (1938)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) reconstructed &ast;_suku_ ‘paw; one quarter (a quarter of the people) = unit of kinship’.  The true meaning emerges from the work of F.A.E. [van Wouden (1935)](bib-van), who was writing his well-known book on the history of social structure in eastern Indonesia at the same time Dempwolff was writing his _Vergleichende Lautlehre_.  Since van Wouden posited an original marriage/alliance system of asymmetric exchange that contained four lineages in an arrangement of ‘circulating connubium’ the &ast;_suku_ would have referred to one of these four lineages, and its otherwise puzzling sense of ‘one fourth’ in languages like [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), which have not used such a system within historical times, becomes intelligible, since the &ast;_suku_ was both a lineage and one quarter of the total social order.


This term is preserved only in a very fragmentary form in a handful of societies in western Indonesia and another handful in eastern Indonesia.  What is noteworthy is that it has been preserved best in societies that have unilineal systems of descent, as among the Batak of northern Sumatra, the Minangkabau of western Sumatra, and a few of the societies of Flores and the Solor archipelago.  The most likely referent for this [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) term was ‘lineage’, that is a social unit that traced descent through a single apical ancestor (male among the Batak and eastern Indonesian groups, female among the Minangkabau).  This inference is fully consistent with others that point to a system of preferential matrilateral cross-cousin marriage in PMP society ([Blust 1993](Source#cldf:blust1993)).",dempwolff193438;blust1993

Apart from a few anomalous glosses ([Kavalan](LanguageTable#cldf:293) _balat_, [Manobo (Western Bukidnon)](LanguageTable#cldf:819) _evaǥat_) the references to cardinal directions in the reflexes are consistent with a west wind centered very near the Equator.

In the western Pacific the orientation of the west monsoon to the north-south axis appears to be somewhat different.  The languages of the Admiralty Islands (all within 2 degrees s. latitude) and a number of those in southeastern Papua (roughly 10 degrees s. latitude) refer to the west monsoon as a ‘northwest’ wind, whereas the languages of both western and eastern Indonesia at corresponding latitudes refer to it as a ‘west’ wind.

28075,*SadiRi,S,housepost,"Also [Casiguran Dumagat](LanguageTable#cldf:569) _adígi_ ‘housepost’ (probably an Ilokano loan), [Kelabit](LanguageTable#cldf:299) _diri_ ‘house post’, [Kiput](LanguageTable#cldf:18958) _pəlirəy_ ‘house post’, [Old Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:660) _ḍiri_ ‘stand, stand upright, remain standing; be in function, reign; standing alone, outstanding, surpassing all others’, [Buginese](LanguageTable#cldf:239) _alliri_ ‘house post’, [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573) _haligi_ ‘fence post, pillar, house post used for structural support’ (probably a [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) loan).  Nataoran Amis _salili_ appears for expected &ast;&ast;_sarili_; the comparative data for this [Amis](LanguageTable#cldf:227) dialect are not yet sufficient to determine whether the assimilation in this form is regular or sporadic, but the cognation of the form is hardly in question.  In this connection it is worth noting that among the [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) aborigines only the Amis, Kavalan  and Ketagalan (the latter now extinct) built houses elevated on posts ([Ferrell 1969:33](Source#cldf:ferrell1969)).  


The necessity of positing [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_SadiRi_ ‘house post’ leaves no alternative but to conclude that this type of residential structure has great antiquity among Austronesian-speaking peoples, and that the house types of the Atayal, Tsou, Paiwan, Rukai, Bunun, and Yami, which are constructed either directly on the ground, or in a shallow excavation, represent architectural innovations.  Such innovations may well have been motivated by a need to adjust to the colder conditions of life in the mountains, or by a need for protection from the seasonal typhoons that periodically sweep westward across the Pacific to southern Taiwan. 

Finally, accounts such as that of [Cunningham (1964)](Source#cldf:cunningham1964) and [Schulte Nordholt (1971:428ff)](Source#cldf:schultenordholt1971) make it clear that the dualistic cosmological symbolism embodied in the [Atoni](LanguageTable#cldf:231) house distinguishes ‘male’ and ‘female’ posts, associated respectively with the right and left sides.  Although the similar dualistic distinction in [Manam](LanguageTable#cldf:328) appears to be based on the length of the post itself rather than on its position within the larger domestic structure, it appears very likely from this linguistic symbolism that speakers of [PCEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19074) made use of some type of dualistic symbolism which was expressed as a male/female contrast in certain of the supporting posts for the house.",ferrell1969[33];cunningham1964;schultenordholt1971[428ff]

Although only the general meaning ‘to smell (transitive)’ can confidently be associated with [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_Sajek_, it is clear from the distribution of semantic reflexes that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_hajek_ referred specifically to the traditional nose kiss of [MP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081)-speaking peoples.",
28089,*SakuC,S,transport piecemeal; tranport through repeated trips,"The fundamental idea expressed in this comparison is that of removing a material from one location to another as result of repeated trips between the two sites.  The natural prototype for such a concept may have been the activity of the mason bee in securing mud for its nest (see &ast;hakut hakut). However, if this activity served as a model for the semantics of &ast;_SakuC_ it appears that its distinctive feature (repeated trips over the same route) had already been abstracted and put to more general use by [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072)  times.",
28092,*Salas,S,"forest, wilderness, woods","Also [Lampung](LanguageTable#cldf:722) _las_ ‘forest, jungle’, [Ngadha](LanguageTable#cldf:357) _kala_ ‘thicket, forest, jungle’.  [Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) reconstructed both &ast;_halas_ (in the form &ast;_alas_) and &ast;_quCaN_ (in the form &ast;_hutan_) meaning ‘forest’.  It is now clear, however, that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_halas_ was a general term for ‘forest, jungle’, while [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_qutan_ (also [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_quCaN_?) referred to a particular category of flora which is perhaps best described by [Brown's (1984)](Source#cldf:brown1984) term ‘grerb’ (‘small plant relative to the plant inventory of a particular environment whose parts are chiefly herbaceous (green, leafy, nonwoody)’.

30098,*SameCi,S,a plant: Solanum nigrum,"Also [Kanakanabu](LanguageTable#cldf:680) _namíci_, [Saaroa](LanguageTable#cldf:974) _ɬamici_, [Rukai (Maga)](LanguageTable#cldf:18979) _amicu_, [Rukai (Tona)](LanguageTable#cldf:970) _amici_, [Itbayaten](LanguageTable#cldf:282) _humti_ ‘_Solanum nigrum_ Linn.’, [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) _amtík_ ~ _agamtík_ ‘nightshade plant, _Solanum nigrum_’, [Hanunóo](LanguageTable#cldf:273) _untí_ ‘a small wild herbaceous plant (_Solanum nigrum_ Linn.); the young leaves are used as a green vegetable by the Hanunóo’, [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) _moti_ ‘morel plant: _Solanum nigrum_ L.’, [Manobo (Western Bukidnon)](LanguageTable#cldf:819) _muti_ ‘a plant: _Solanum nigrum_’, [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285) _ranti_ ‘tomato’, [Manggarai](LanguageTable#cldf:816) _kenti_ ‘a wild vegetable: _Solanum nigrum_’. This word shows multiple irregular variations, making any reconstruction difficult. I have arbitrarily chosen to compare [Paiwan](LanguageTable#cldf:370) _sametsi_ with forms in other languages that are ambiguous for initial &ast;_S_ or zero.  



Finally, I am indebted to R. David Zorc for drawing my attention to the [Itbayaten](LanguageTable#cldf:282) and [Manobo (Western Bukidnon)](LanguageTable#cldf:819) forms, and for reminding me that he proposed an alternative reconstruction, &ast;_SamŭCi_, in [Zorc (1982:118)](Source#cldf:zorc1982).  Zorc’s motivation for positing an unstressed high back vowel in this form was to relate the otherwise unexplained high back vowels in [Maga Rukai](LanguageTable#cldf:18979) _amicu_ (metathesis of &ast;i and &ast;u), Itbayaten humti (metathesis of &ast;a and &ast;u), Hanunóo untí (metathesis of &ast;_a_ and &ast;_u_), [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) _moti_, and [Manobo (Western Bukidnon)](LanguageTable#cldf:819) _muti_. 



The precarious nature of this reconstruction, however, should be obvious, since: it requires the assumption of 1) two different metathesis patterns in three different languages, 2) an irregular loss of &ast;_S-_ in [Hanunóo](LanguageTable#cldf:273) and [Manobo (Western Bukidnon)](LanguageTable#cldf:819) (this would be equally true if these forms were assigned to the present reconstruction), 3) syncope of an unstressed low vowel &ast;_a_ in [Itbayaten](LanguageTable#cldf:282) and [Hanunóo](LanguageTable#cldf:273), and 4) an irregular loss of prepenultimate &ast;_a_ (rather than reduction to schwa) in [Manobo (Western Bukidnon)](LanguageTable#cldf:819).  Moreover, it forces us to assume that the well-known syncope of schwa /VC__CV also applied to other vowels, including both &ast;_u_ and &ast;_a_.  I know of no evidence that might justify this assumption, which should be apparent in any of these languages that undergo rightward stress shift through suffixation (none of them shows a syncope pattern when this happens).  Add to this the fact that the initial consonants of the [Kanakanabu](LanguageTable#cldf:680), [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285), and [Manggarai](LanguageTable#cldf:816) forms, the medial vowel of the [Kanakanabu](LanguageTable#cldf:680), [Saaroa](LanguageTable#cldf:974) and [Rukai](LanguageTable#cldf:397) forms, and the final consonant of the [Ilokano](LanguageTable#cldf:279) form are unexplained by either reconstruction, and it appears clearly preferable  to settle on &ast;_SameCi_ and leave the rest of these apparently related but wildly irregular forms unexplained.",zorc1982[118]

Despite occasional nominal derivatives, [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_SapaR_, [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_hampaR_ clearly was a verb meaning ‘to spread out’.  Its prototype referent appears to have been the unrolling of mats onto the ground, although in several witnesses metaphorical extensions refer to the dispersal of small discrete objects. Under his &ast;_hampa(r)_ ‘spread out, stretch out’ [Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) also included proposed cognates in a number of [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) languages (e.g. [Sa'a](LanguageTable#cldf:18945) _epa_ ‘to lie as a mat, of yam vines’, [Fijian](LanguageTable#cldf:266) _yabata_ ‘cover up with mats’, [Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434) _ʔepa_ ‘mats (collectively) given to a bride’).

The [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) reflex of &ast;_Sapejiq_ does not show the expected development of an original trisyllable with medial &ast;_e_ (cf.

In addition to their general verbal meanings, reflexes of [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) &ast;_hapit_ have two recurrent nominal senses: 1. the members of a wedding party who flank (‘squeeze in’) the bride or groom at the wedding ceremony, and 2. a part of the indigenous backstrap loom.  The distribution of forms with the former meaning is limited to two known languages ([Bahasa Indonesia](LanguageTable#cldf:240), [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325)), and probably is due to borrowing.  Reflexes of &ast;_hapit_ which refer to a part of the backstrap loom are, however, more widespread ([Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314), [Sundanese](LanguageTable#cldf:418), [Balinese](LanguageTable#cldf:235), [Sasak](LanguageTable#cldf:404), [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947)), and are less likely to be products of diffusion.  


More difficult is the problem of achieving an exact gloss: with reference to the loom [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) &ast;_hapit_ evidently designated a structure consisting of two wooden slats between which the warp threads were pinched.  Judging from the glosses in [Sundanese](LanguageTable#cldf:418) and [Tae'](LanguageTable#cldf:18947), this structure extended across the lap of a seated weaver, and was bound at its ends by thongs which extended around her padded hips so as to control the desired tension on the warp threads.",dempwolff193438

The etymon of this widespread cognate set clearly referred to the sharpening of worn tool edges, and not merely to grating or grinding in general.  It is compatible with a hypothesis that either edge-ground stone tools or metal tools of some type were in use among [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) speakers (c. 4,000 B.C.).

However, this gloss fails to account for the fact that reflexes of &ast;_SateD_ refer not just to this general semantic range, but more specifically to 1. a ceremonial escorting of the bride to the wedding or to her new husband (in connection with patrilocal residence?), and 2. to some form of material exchange, probably involving bridewealth ([Bikol](LanguageTable#cldf:244), [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245), [Numfor](LanguageTable#cldf:364)).

The precise semantic agreement in the glosses of [Kavalan](LanguageTable#cldf:293) _sawaq_ and [Hanunóo](LanguageTable#cldf:273) _háwak_ ‘back of the waist’, and the somewhat wavering English gloss ‘waist, hips’ in several languages suggest that the referent of &ast;_Sawak_ did not correspond exactly to any semantic category of English. Rather, the available information suggests that [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_Sawak_ and [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_hawak_ referred to the unprotected space between the rib cage and the pelvic bone which is not covered by the muscles of the abdominal diaphragm, hence a part of the body corresponding roughly to the English concept ‘waist’, but applying only to the sides and back.",

In attested  Austronesian-speaking societies from Taiwan to the western Pacific the fruit of the areca palm is chewed as a mild stimulant, either by individuals alone or as part of a social ‘lubricant’, in some cases connected with formal events such as wedding engagements.   More exactly, what is chewed is the betel quid, a packet consisting of an outer leaf wrapping the nut and a small quantity of lime made by crushing the shells of marine molluscs or coral.  In Taiwan the practice has spread in recent centuries to the Han Chinese community, who must have learned it from the native populace.

Although [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_Semay_ apparently meant ‘cooked rice’, the meaning of [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:19083) &ast;_hemay_ is less certain.  Both in northern Luzon and in [Sangir](LanguageTable#cldf:402) of northern Sulawesi, [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:19083) &ast;_hemay_ is reflected in the meaning ‘rice in the field; unhusked rice’, and [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:19083) &ast;_ka-hemay-an_ ‘rice field’ supports a similar gloss for the unaffixed stem.  


At the same time, however, a number of languages in the central Philippines agree with [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) reflexes and with such variant forms in western Indonesia as [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427) _eme_ and [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _imai_ in supporting a gloss ‘cooked rice’.  In either case there are competing forms for the meaning in question.  

[PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_pajay_ clearly meant ‘rice in the field; unhusked rice’, and in this sense evidently persisted in [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:19083).  Although reflexes of both &ast;_kaen-en_ and &ast;_nasi_ mean ‘cooked rice’ in widely separated languages, the former set of terms almost certainly developed this sense as a result of convergent change from an original meaning ‘what is eaten’, while some reflexes of the latter probably are borrowings of [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _nasi_ ‘cooked rice’.",
28184,*Semut,S,"smothering, suffocating",I assume that [Saisiyat](LanguageTable#cldf:400) has assimilated the reflex of &ast;_u_ to the other three vowels in the only form of this word that is given in [Li (1978)](Source#cldf:li1978).,li1978

30272,*Seŋaw,S,to breathe (?),"Also [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) _seŋaw_ ‘breath; vapor’.  The semantic differerence between this and [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_Seŋad_ is unclear.  Reflexes of the latter uniformly mean to ‘to breathe’, whereas reflexes of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_Seŋaw_ are more diverse, and hence more difficult to assign to a uniform meaning.",
28187,*Sepat,S,four,"Also Taroko _kn-spat-an_ ‘in four days’, [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314) _p-empat-en_ ‘the fourth day’, [Kambera](LanguageTable#cldf:678) _ka-patu-ŋu_ ‘by fours, four at a time’.  [Itbayaten](LanguageTable#cldf:282) _kak-ápat_ ‘a fourth part, one-fourth’, [Pangasinan](LanguageTable#cldf:920) _kak-ápat_ ‘one-fourth, quarter’ appears to be a valid comparison, but without wider attestation I hesitate to assign it to [PPh](LanguageTable#cldf:19083).  


Perhaps the most noteworthy feature of &ast;_Sepat_ and its reflexes is the exceptionally large number of morphologically complex forms which can be reconstructed.  Some of these contain productive affixes which also occur with other numerals.  Others, as &ast;_pat-a_, &ast;_pat-aŋ_, and &ast;_pat-i_, contain presumptive suffixes which do not occur elsewhere, and are of dubious morphological status. 


 In addition to those forms which have been reconstructed, the following morphologically similar reflexes of &ast;_Sepat_ are assumed to be products of convergent development:",

This comparison is a noteworthy example of how fossilized morphology together with regular sound change can thoroughly disguise the connection of related forms, even when recurrent phonological correspondences have been established. Thus, without knowledge of the morphology, [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _hiyáʔ_ could correspond only to &ast;&ast;_ia_ in most [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) languages.  The development of [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076), [South Halmahera-West New Guinea](LanguageTable#cldf:20002), and [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) forms has been: &ast;_ma-Seyaq_ > _ma-siaq_ > _ma-hiaq_ > _maiaq_ > _mayaq_, and thus exactly parallels the development of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_ma-Suab_ [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_mawap_ ‘to yawn’.  Following the reanalysis of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_ma-Seyaq_ as [PCEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19074) &ast;_mayaq_, many [CEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19074) languages reinterpreted this historically stative/attributive form as nominal (‘shame, shyness’) and added a historically secondary stative/attributive prefix &ast;_ma-_, yielding [PCEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19074) &ast;_mayaq_ ‘shyness, shame’, &ast;_ma-mayaq_ ‘shy, ashamed’.  The parallel developments in [Sangir](LanguageTable#cldf:402) _ma-mea_ and [Banggai](LanguageTable#cldf:238) _ma-maa_ are assumed to be products of convergence, since a reflex of &ast;_Seyaq_ is retained as a separate morpheme in other [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) languages.",
28200,*Seyup,S,"blowing on (a fire, etc.)","Also [Bontok](LanguageTable#cldf:246) _ayóp_ ‘blow on, as a fire in order to make it flame’.  Some liberties have been taken in the comparison of morphologically complex reflexes of &ast;_Seyup_ and &ast;_tiup_ in order to argue for the antiquity of certain morphologically complex forms of &ast;_Seyup_.  One other item that can be added to the comparison for &ast;_Seyup Seyup_ in this connection is [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _tiup-tiup_ ‘mouth organ’, [Malay (Baba)](LanguageTable#cldf:19005) _tiop-tiop api_ ‘bellows’.",
28201,*Sezam,S,"borrow, lend","[Singhi Land Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:412) _ñam_ is assumed to be _njam_, with the type of nasal-obstruent sequence that has been called an ""implosive"" nasal ([Coady and McGinn 1982](bib-Coady)) or a ""funny"" nasal ([Durie 1985](Source#cldf:durie1985)).  The parallel suffixation in [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _mem-injam-kan_ ‘lend something to someone’ and [Wolio](LanguageTable#cldf:1124) _pa-ada-aka_ ‘lend (something)’ is assumed to result from a historically independent ‘capture’ of the preposition &ast;_aken_ in both languages.  [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _híram-an_ ‘person from whom or place from which one may borrow something or things’, [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _pinjam-an_ ‘thing borrowed; loan’ may point to [PWMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) &ast;_hezam-an_, but the [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) suffix could reflect &ast;_-en_.  


Finally, it is noteworthy that at least three widely separated [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) languages ([Kiput](LanguageTable#cldf:18958), [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285), [Sangir](LanguageTable#cldf:402)) make a lexical distinction between the borrowing of an object that must itself be returned (e.g. a book), and the borrowing of an object that can be returned in kind (e.g. rice, money).  Although these distinct glosses cannot yet be assigned to different reconstructed forms, it appears unlikely that such a distinction would develop independently.  If not, &ast;_Sezam_ presumably referred to only one type of borrowing, while some other verb yet to be reconstructed referred to the other.",durie1985

However, it is well-known that pronouns commonly undergo irregular sound changes, in part because of their high text frequency, and in part because of the tendency for pronoun systems to be restructured while retaining the elements that compose them ([Blust 1977](Source#cldf:blust1977)).

The cognation of such [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) forms as [Seimat](LanguageTable#cldf:19050) _maw_ (where only -/w/ remains from the original stem) with  [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) forms such as [Kelabit](LanguageTable#cldf:299) _uab_ is clear from the fairly abundant intermediate forms that reflect [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_ma-Suab_ ( > _ma-huab_ > _ma-uab_ > _mawab_).  


A perfect parallel is seen in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_ma-Seyaq_, [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_mayaq_ ‘shy, ashamed’.  In both cases the boundary between the stative prefix &ast;_ma-_ and the stem has been lost in all [CEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19074) witnesses.  The only non-[CEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19074) language in which a similar loss of morpheme boundary has taken place is [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573) (with _magap_, for expected &ast;&ast;_magwap_ ‘yawn’).  Following the reanalysis of &ast;_ma-uab_ as &ast;_mawab_ a number of [CEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19074) languages have either introduced a new stative marker, or have reduplicated the first syllable of the new stem.  It remains unclear how many of these added syllables (if any) are the result of convergent developments.",
28294,*Suaji,S,younger sibling,"Also [Manggarai](LanguageTable#cldf:816) _asé_ ‘younger sibling of the same sex’; friend’, [Nali](LanguageTable#cldf:878) _nali_ ‘sibling of the same sex’, [Lau](LanguageTable#cldf:313) _sāsi_ ( = _sa asiʔ_) ‘younger sibling of the same sex’.  [Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) reconstructed doublets &ast;_a(ŋ)ji_ ‘sibling, consanguine (generally younger)’ and &ast;_qa(ŋ)ji_ ‘sibling, consanguine (generally of the opposite sex)’.  The far richer evidence now available supports a trisyllabic etymon, but recurrent, mutually corroboratory irregularities leave open the possibility that we should reconstruct both &ast;_Suaji_ and &ast;_Saji_.  As evidence for the latter, disyllabic variant, we can cite [Proto-Rukai](LanguageTable#cldf:19086) _&ast;agi_, [Ifugaw](LanguageTable#cldf:636) _agí_, [Balangaw](LanguageTable#cldf:509) _agí_, [Kallahan (Kayapa)](LanguageTable#cldf:676) _agí_, [Pangasinan](LanguageTable#cldf:920) _agí_, [Sambal (Botolan)](LanguageTable#cldf:18976) _ali_, [Kalamian Tagbanwa](LanguageTable#cldf:18285) _ariʔ_, ATA _hari_, [Manobo (Western Bukidnon)](LanguageTable#cldf:819) _hazi_, [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) _ari_ and various forms in western Indonesia (some of which -- like [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _adé-k_ -- can regularly reflect either variant).  The presence of &ast;_-u-_ is, however, clearly supported by all [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) reflexes noted to date apart from [Proto-Rukai](LanguageTable#cldf:19086) _&ast;agi_, by many reflexes in the northern Philippines, by [Tunjung](LanguageTable#cldf:1091) _gari-n_, by [Mentawai](LanguageTable#cldf:335) _bagi_, and by a number of reflexes in [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076) languages.  



Because no [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) reflex is known to make us of a relative sex distinction, [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_Suaji_ must be reconstructed with the meaning ‘younger sibling’. However, agreement between at least [Manobo (Ata)](LanguageTable#cldf:818), [Tboli](LanguageTable#cldf:19175) and [Toba Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:427)  suggest that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_huaji_ meant ‘younger sibling of the same sex’.  It is clear that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) had four sibling terms: &ast;_betaw_ ‘sister’ (man speaking)’, &ast;_ñaRa_ ‘brother (woman speaking)’, &ast;_huaji_ and &ast;_kaka_.  Whether a relative sex distinction was or was not made in the terms &ast;_huaji_ and &ast;_kaka_, there can be no doubt that the former referred to younger and the latter to elder siblings.  In both [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) and Southern Toraja relative sex is used in the definition of cross-sibling terms, yet reflexes of &ast;_huaji_ and &ast;_kaka_ evidently apply to siblings of either sex regardless of sex of speaker. 



 It is possible that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) possessed a similar system, and that the more specific references to younger or elder siblings of the _same_ sex evolved independently in [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) and [CEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19074) languages as a result of a tendency to divide up semantic space into mutually exclusive categories.  I find this scenario less convincing than the hypothesis that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_kaka_ and &ast;_huaji_ contained a relative sex component which became otiose and disappeared in those societies that lost descent groups (with which relative sex has an established positive correlation cross-culturally).  In addition to its literal sibling referents both [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_Suaji_ and [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_huaji_ evidently referred to relatives in general, a fact noted as early as 1933 by F.A.E. van Wouden, who proposed an explanation for it ([van Wouden 1968 [1935]:120](bib-van)).  Finally, it appears likely from agreements in such widely scattered languages as [Karo Batak](LanguageTable#cldf:18314), [Balinese](LanguageTable#cldf:235), [Sasak](LanguageTable#cldf:404) and [Gedaged](LanguageTable#cldf:269) that [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_huaji_  could refer in certain contexts to the afterbirth or placenta (also cp. [Numfor](LanguageTable#cldf:364) _naʔik_ ‘sibling of the same sex; afterbirth, placenta’, where the same semantic association is found with a morpheme that does not reflect &ast;_huaji_).",dempwolff193438

The conch shell trumpet is well-known in the Pacific, where it played an important traditional role in the launching of voyaging canoes, the calling of members of the village to ceremonies, providing an alert to imminent danger, etc.  However, this reconstruction presents special problems, since its [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) status depends crucially on [Tiruray](LanguageTable#cldf:433) (and the indirect support provided by the [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372) evidence for the doublet &ast;_tabuRiq_).  In addition, a number of languages in the Philippines reflect a word with irregular &ast;_R_ > _l_, as with the [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252) form just cited or similar forms in other languages of the Philippines (see Note to &ast;_tabuRiq_).  These appear to be loanwords, although the usual appeal to [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) as a source language does not work well here.  Given the limited set of forms that he compared, [Dempwolff (1938)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) erroneously reconstructed &ast;_tam-buri_ ‘triton shell trumpet’.

The limited pattern of survival of this form in both the Philippines and Indonesia suggests that it either disappeared among groups that moved inland to a montane environment where the conch was not easily obtained, or was replaced among lowlanders through contact-induced culture change.  All in all the pattern of distribution for reflexes of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_tabuRi_ (and its doublet form &ast;_tabuRiq_) suggests that survival was most strongly favored in areas of cultural conservatism, and disfavored where traditional practices either competed or conflicted with those introduced from outside, as among hispanized Filipinos, where the use of animal horns apparently came to be favored over shell trumpets, or among the peoples of western Indonesia, where overlays of Indian and Islamic cultural influence have altered many aspects of the traditional cultures of lowland groups.",dempwolff193438;ross1988[147]

[Dempwolff (1938)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) posited doublets &ast;_tanah_ and &ast;_tanəh_ ‘earth, land’, assigning [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) _tana_ ‘rice field’ to the first of these, and _tanah_ ‘a land’ as in _tanah Jawa_ ‘the land of Java’ or _tanah belanda_ ‘Holland’ to the second.  However, the basis for this distinction is shaky.  [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) _tana_ is a native term, while _tanah_ is clearly a borrowing of [Banjarese](LanguageTable#cldf:243) _tanah_. Many languages have merged [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_a_ and &ast;_e_ before the reflex of word-final _&ast;q_, usually after it became a glottal stop.  It is the neutralization of this phonemic distinction before glottal stop that has given rise to the impression that there was a variant &ast;_tanaq_, which probably never existed.  
In addition to the subentries cited above the recurrent pattern of a reflex of &ast;_taneq_ + a place name suggests that the expression &ast;_taneq_ + place name existed in [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) times.  


Finally, in some Oceanic languages, where final consonants have been lost, the reflexes of [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_tanoq_ ‘earth, soil’ and &ast;_tanom_ ‘to plant, bury’ can be difficult to distinguish, and in fact are often combined by lexicographers or comparativists, as with [Keesing (1975)](Source#cldf:keesing1975), who gives [Kwaio](LanguageTable#cldf:307) _ano_ ‘land, ground’, a clear reflex of [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_tanoq_, but the  subentry _anom-ia_ ‘plant, bury’, which is just as clearly a reflex of [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_tanom_, or [Fox (1974)](Source#cldf:fox1974), who gives [Lau](LanguageTable#cldf:313) _ano_ ‘earth, land’, but the subentry _ano-mila_ ‘burying’, which exemplifies the same problem.  Similarly, [Bender et al (2003)](Source#cldf:benderetal2003) posit proto-Micronesian &ast;_tano_ ‘ground, low’, but refer additionally to e.g. [Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434) _tano_ ‘place of burial, cemetery’, which clearly reflects [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_tanom_.",dempwolff193438;keesing1975;fox1974;benderetal2003

Although the terms ‘year’ and ‘season’ occur in a number of the glosses cited here, it is clear that these must be connected more with the growing cycle of food plants and with greater or lesser rainfall than with vegetative changes in the natural environment of the kind associated with the seasons in temperate climates.

29990,*taRah,t,to wait,"[PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_taRah_ ‘to wait’ is intriguing for several reasons. First, it is one of the few cognate sets which appears to provide evidence of homorganic nasal substitution in Formosan languages. Second, reflexes of &ast;_ma-naRah_ vs. &ast;_taRah_ are found even within the Atayalic group, distinguishing dialects of [Atayal](LanguageTable#cldf:493) from those of [Seediq](LanguageTable#cldf:407) ([Li 2004:688](bib-Li)), thus implying that &ast;_maŋ-_ was active in the relatively recent history of these languages, despite its general absence in Taiwan. Third, &ast;_taRah_ carries a variety of different affixes in all languages that reflect it, and it is very difficult to find examples of the simple base. Despite initial appearances, however, [Atayal](LanguageTable#cldf:493), [Seediq](LanguageTable#cldf:407) and all known MP reflexes provide evidence for a doublet &ast;_naRa_, and it is the prefixation of this base that has given the false impression of homorganic nasal subsitution.  Part of this comparison was first recognized by [Tsuchida (1976:232)](Source#cldf:tsuchida1976).",tsuchida1976[232]

However, the data suggests a complex history of reanalysis that raises questions about the correctness of these reconstructions.  




The forms cited above point clearly to a trisyllable ending in _&ast;i_.  According to [Lanyon-Orgill (1962)](Source#cldf:lanyonorgill1962) Tolai (Raluana) _tarami_ is both a transitive and an intransitive verb.  It thus carries no morphological marking for transitivity.  However, most trisyllabic words in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) that ended with &ast;_-i_ would have been disyllabic bases with the transitive suffix &ast;_-i_.  In a monomorphemic base of this shape that was additionally a verb there would have been strong canonical pressure to reanalyze &ast;_taRamʷi_ as &ast;_taRamʷ-i_, and in languages that had already lost final consonants it is likely that this reanalysis would further treat the nasal as a thematic consonant, yielding an innovated base &ast;_taRa_.  This seems to have been what happened in e.g. [Nggela](LanguageTable#cldf:359) _tala_ ‘to allow, permit; to agree, be willing; to nod in assent; to answer’, from a reanalyzed form &ast;_taRa(m)-i_, which then allowed the attachment of the applicative suffix &ast;_-aki_ to yield _tala(m)-agi_ ‘to agree to, make an agreement; to allow; to obey’.  A similar process evidently affected all Southeast Solomonic languages, as seen in [Kwaio](LanguageTable#cldf:307) _ala faafia_ ‘agree on’ (< _&ast;taRa_), _alamia_ ‘permit, allow’ (< &ast;_taRa(m)-ia_, or [Lau](LanguageTable#cldf:313) _ala-lā_ ‘an agreement’ (< &ast;_taRa_), _ala-mai_ ‘answer, obey, allow, take notice of’ (< &ast;_taRa_),  _alami_ ‘to answer, assent to; suit, fit, be worthy of’ (< &ast;_taRa(m)-i_.  By contrast, [Toqabaqita](LanguageTable#cldf:19197) _alamania_/_alamatania_ ‘allow someone to do something; let someone do something’, and  [Mota](LanguageTable#cldf:344) _taram_ ‘to suit, be becoming to, match’, _tarama_ ‘to answer a call’, _taramag_ ‘to answer another’ appear to reflect a base &ast;_taRama_, which may have arisen by back-formation from &ast;_taRa(m)-aki_, where the latter was interpreted as &ast;_taRama-aki_, with coalescence of two identical vowels.  




Without some such history of misanalyzed base forms and reinterpretation it would appear necessary to reconstruct doublets &ast;_taRama_ and &ast;_taRamʷi_ or &ast;_taRama_ and &ast;_taRa_, as Geraghty did, since there is no clear morphological precedent for analyzing the first of these forms as &ast;_taRa-ma_.",geraghty1990[73];lanyonorgill1962

The central sense of this term evidently was ‘to shape wood by adzing’, and it presumably would have applied primarily to the shaping of timbers in house construction, and of tree trunks into the hulls of canoes.  Given its meaning it implies the use of adzes as distinct from axes, machetes, and knives, and therefore the existence of a [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) term for ‘adze’ which is yet to be reconstructed.  Working with an adze involves a striking motion toward the actor, a semantic feature of this term that crops up in other senses, as in [Asilulu](LanguageTable#cldf:18016) _ta-tala_ ‘coconut rasp’, [Arosi](LanguageTable#cldf:485) _ara_ ‘to hoe’, or the [Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434) and [Rennellese](LanguageTable#cldf:390) forms that refer to scooping up sand or small fish.  In [Fijian](LanguageTable#cldf:266) and the Polynesian languages, on the other hand, the original sense of movement toward the actor in adzing wood evolved into a generalized notion of hitting, chopping, cutting, bailing water (by ‘striking’ at it with a paddle or bailer), or more abstractly, of killing.",

This remarkable comparison is of special interest for at least two reasons.  First, it is customarily assumed that &ast;_R_ > _r_ immediately preceding a dental consonant in [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372) (&ast;_uRat_ > _ŋurd_ ‘vein, artery’), but otherwise became _s_ (&ast;_(d)aRaq_ > _rásech_ ‘blood’, &ast;_zaRum_ > _rasm_ ‘needle’).  However, _derúdm_ suggests that &ast;_R_ > _r_ in [Palauan](LanguageTable#cldf:372) if the following syllable began with a dental consonant, even if the intervening vowel was not lost.  


The second noteworthy feature of this cognate set is its range of semantic reflexes.  Subgrouping considerations make it all but certain that the word referred originally to the puffer fish or porcupine fish, as this meaning is reflected both in [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) and in [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) languages.  Among Austronesian speakers that became reoriented to a primarily inland environment the meaning was shifted to cover other roundish, spiny biota (porcupine, durian).  A parallel semantic extension is seen in [Pohnpeian](LanguageTable#cldf:381) _sei_, where the reference to the soursop could hardly be original, as the plant is said to be a native of tropical America ([Merrill 1954:152](Source#cldf:merrill1954)).

The relation of [Kenyah](LanguageTable#cldf:300) _təka_ to the other forms cited here might be questioned, but the semantic relationship of this form to the rest is supported by the extended meaning of [Mapun](LanguageTable#cldf:19176) _(ka)-takka-han_, which incorporates both the notion of a personal arrival and of the ‘arrival’ of an emotional or physical state that settles on one.  [Dempwolff (1938)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) reconstructed this form on the basis of data from [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285), [Sa'a](LanguageTable#cldf:18945) and [Fijian](LanguageTable#cldf:266).

Although this reconstruction is firmly established on the [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) level, the [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) form is far less certain, and its possible relationship to [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_teka_ ‘to come, arrive; reach as far as; reach a destination; to complete’ remains an open question.  Whereas [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_teka_ seems clearly to be a verb of motion, referring to coming, arrival and the like, [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_tekas_ has a much more static sense, as of something for which motion or agitation has ceased.  


The breadth of linked meanings across reflexes of this form is remarkable, ranging from the notion of birds settling down from flight on the branches of a tree ([Proto-Bungku-Tolaki](LanguageTable#cldf:19187), [Sa'a](LanguageTable#cldf:18945), [Arosi](LanguageTable#cldf:485), [Nukuoro](LanguageTable#cldf:363)), to sitting (many), to boats running aground ([Wayan](LanguageTable#cldf:19060), [Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434)), to general calmness ([Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434), [Futunan](LanguageTable#cldf:607), [Samoan](LanguageTable#cldf:401), [Rennellese](LanguageTable#cldf:390)), to congealment (hence

Since cognate linguistic forms have not been found it is unclear whether this tradition represents a continuation of the practice from [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072), or is an independent invention after it had first been lost.",

This comparison raises a number of questions.  The first reaction of many would be to dismiss it as a loanword that probably postdates Indian cultural contact beginning around 2,000 BP.  There is no question that many or all of the forms cited in this note and probably some cited in the above comparison are loanwords, but the entire set cannot be dismissed, as in many cases the sound correspondences are regular and fairly complex.  If the entire set of forms is a product of borrowing then it is necessary to identify a source language, and in most widely-attested loan distributions in island Southeast Asia this is [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326). However, [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _timah_ can hardly have been the source of most Philippine forms or of [Kelabit](LanguageTable#cldf:299) _səməraʔ_, which collectively point to a protoform in a language ancestral to at least the languages of the Philippines and much of western Indonesia, implying a time-depth of perhaps 4,000 years.",

Since Taiwan lies just outside the monsoon climatic zone the meaning of these terms in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) is somewhat less clearcut than the [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) equivalents, which clearly refer to the seasonal rain-bearing winds that are associated in the northern Philippines, where [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) probably was spoken, with the southwest and southeast monsoons. The directional content of reflexes necessarily changed as Austronesian speakers expanded southward from Taiwan and the Philippines to the Equator and beyond, but the connection with the monsoons is maintained in much of insular Southeast Asia and the western Pacific.  Further east, beyond the reach of the monsoon regime the combination of seasonality, direction, rain and wind that characterizes the monsoons is lost, but various components of the meaning are retained, especially in Polynesian languages, where reflexes include references to rain, strong wind and destruction caused by storms.",

While ‘sit’ and ‘reside in a place’ are often found together, this word also applies to inanimate objects such as fluids congealing to become solid, or to sediment settling to the bottom, both of which involve the idea of a cessation of motion.

[Thao](LanguageTable#cldf:1062) _mashi-tuqash_ probably is a [Bunun](LanguageTable#cldf:250) loan, and [Chamorro](LanguageTable#cldf:573) _matua_ probably was _matuʔa_, but was lost with the hispanization of Chamorro culture before phonetically accurate transcriptions became available.  


[Dempwolff](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) reconstructed a version of this term with the meaning ‘old’, but the semantics of &ast;_tuqaS_ and its derivative &ast;_ma-tuqaS_ appear far more complex than this.  With regard to &ast;_tuqaS_, a connection between [Thao](LanguageTable#cldf:1062) _tuqash_ ‘primary forest, with large trees; wilderness’ and various kin terms based on the same base was previously overlooked.  However, [Muna](LanguageTable#cldf:350) _ka-tugha_ means ‘forest, jungle’, the gloss for [Asilulu](LanguageTable#cldf:18016) _matua_ includes ‘very old, of huge trees’, and that for [Samoan](LanguageTable#cldf:401) _matua_ includes ‘(of bush, forest) be dense, thick’.  These agreements between widely separated languages, together with the [Tarakan](LanguageTable#cldf:1052), [Maloh](LanguageTable#cldf:327) and [Singhi Land Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:412) terms cited above (< &ast;_tuqaS-an_?) suggest that one component of the meaning of [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_tuqaS_ was ‘old growth forest; old, of forest’.  



A related sense of ‘ripe, mature’ applies to fruit in languages reaching from western Borneo to Polynesia, and is extended to the meaning ‘mature, of persons, adult’ over much the same area.  The meaning of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_ma-tuqah_ appears to have been primarily stative, but reflexes meaning ‘parent-in-law’ in western Indonesia, ‘mother’s brother’ in Oceanic languages and both ‘father-in-law’ and ‘mother’s brother’ in Central-Malayo-Polynesian languages such as [Manggarai](LanguageTable#cldf:816), support an inference that this affixed form also served as a key element uniting consanguineal and affinal kin terms, and in doing so implied the existence of a [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) system of preferred matrilateral cross-cousin marriage, or asymmetric exchange (cf.

In some cases the apparent support for &ast;_t-_ rather than &ast;_C-_ may be due to unrecognized narrow conditions, as in [Puyuma](LanguageTable#cldf:386), which evidently does not permit dissimilar retroflex stops within the same morpheme, and dissimilates the first of these to its alveolar counerpart.  However, a similar appeal to conditioning appears to be more difficult for [Pazeh](LanguageTable#cldf:375) and [Thao](LanguageTable#cldf:1062). 



As [Wilkinson (1959:1242)](Source#cldf:wilkinson1959) has noted for [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), the association of the innovative word for ‘seven’ with the index finger derives from a system of finger-counting in which the thumb moves from little finger to index finger and then reverses direction, encountering the index finger for the second time after the thumb has served for both ‘five’ and ‘six’. Reflexes of &ast;_tuzuq_ in the indisputably innovative meaning ‘seven’ are of some interest for the internal subgrouping of WMP languages, as they include the languages of Sabah and Sarawak (but not of southeastern Borneo), [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) and its closest relatives, the Chamic languages and [Sundanese](LanguageTable#cldf:418) (but not [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285)). However, many of the languages of Sabah also share an indisputably innovative word for ‘nine’ (reflecting &ast;_siam_) with most of the languages of the Philippines. Since at least one of these lexical innovations must have acquired its attested distribution in part by diffusion the potential subgrouping value of &ast;_tuzuq_ in the meaning ‘seven’ is somewhat compromised.",wilkinson1959[1242]

The reduplication in [Maranao](LanguageTable#cldf:331) _ori ori_ ‘last to come, one at the end of the line’, [Samoan](LanguageTable#cldf:401) _muli muli_ ‘follow, be done afterwards; last’ and some other languages probably is convergent, as is the assimilation of the last vowel in [Loniu](LanguageTable#cldf:321) _muʔu tun_ ‘stern of a canoe’, [Duke of York](LanguageTable#cldf:588) _muru_ ‘to follow behind, afterwards; the back; the last’.  



The number of instances of &ast;_h_ in this form is somewhat unclear. [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423), [Bikol](LanguageTable#cldf:244), [Manobo (Western Bukidnon)](LanguageTable#cldf:819)  and [Tausug](LanguageTable#cldf:18831)  appear to reflect &ast;_h-_, but Bisayan reflexes (which show epenthetic vowels inserted after the regular syncope of shwa) suggest that these forms may involve metathesis of earlier &ast;_urhí_ (> _hurí_).  The presence of _final_ /_h_/ is suggested by suffixed forms in [Aklanon](LanguageTable#cldf:226),  but is contradicted by [Itbayaten](LanguageTable#cldf:282) and [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252).



The most interesting feature of this form undoubtedly is its meaning, which cannot be captured by any single, readily available semantic category of English. Perhaps the most basic and concrete sense of &ast;_udehi_ and its derivatives is ‘behind, coming after or later; be last’.  In this sense it (like the demonstrative pronouns &ast;_-Cu_, &ast;_-na_, &ast;_-ni_, etc.) has both a spatial and a temporal reference.  



In its temporal sense &ast;_udehi_ referred not only to posteriority in sequence, but to future time in general (cf. [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _kemudian hari_, and semantically similar reflexes in [Wolio](LanguageTable#cldf:1124), [Sika](LanguageTable#cldf:414), [Kei](LanguageTable#cldf:298), [Tuvaluan](LanguageTable#cldf:19417)  and [Maori](LanguageTable#cldf:330)).  This usage is striking, since the spatial imagery of the future in Indo-European languages typically places it _before,_ not behind the observer. 



Two other concrete senses of &ast;_udehi_ that are widely reflected are ‘stern/rudder of a boat’ (reflexes in [Kelabit](LanguageTable#cldf:299), [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), [Kambera](LanguageTable#cldf:678), various languages of western Melanesia, and [Hawaiian](LanguageTable#cldf:620)), and ‘youngest child’ ( = ‘one who comes last’, with reflexes in [Isneg](LanguageTable#cldf:647), [Ifugaw](LanguageTable#cldf:636), [Kambera](LanguageTable#cldf:678), [Rotinese](LanguageTable#cldf:395), [Yamdena](LanguageTable#cldf:1130)  and [Maori](LanguageTable#cldf:330)).  



A number of other meanings appear to be confined to [CEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19074)  languages, and it is assumed that these are semantic innovations rather than retentions that have been lost in all non-[CEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19074)  languages.  These include: 1. the meaning ‘west’, attested in [Rotinese](LanguageTable#cldf:395) of the Lesser Sundas, and in such Polynesian languages as [Rennellese](LanguageTable#cldf:390) and [Anuta](LanguageTable#cldf:229), 2. ‘young’, reflected in [Rotinese](LanguageTable#cldf:395), [Selaru](LanguageTable#cldf:409), [Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434), [Niue](LanguageTable#cldf:362), [Samoan](LanguageTable#cldf:401)  and [Hawaiian](LanguageTable#cldf:620), 3. ‘outside’, reflected in [Yamdena](LanguageTable#cldf:1130), [Fordata](LanguageTable#cldf:18184), [Gedaged](LanguageTable#cldf:269), [Nggela](LanguageTable#cldf:359)  and [Arosi](LanguageTable#cldf:485), and 4. ‘heel’, reflected in [Lau](LanguageTable#cldf:313), [Rennellese](LanguageTable#cldf:390)  and [Kapingamarangi](LanguageTable#cldf:292).  Of these four innovative meanings the last appears to have arisen in [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082)  or some descendant thereof.  Although it is not attested in strictly cognate forms, it appears safe to infer that [POc](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) &ast;_m-uri qaqe_, &ast;_m-uri waqe_ meant ‘heel’.  The second semantic innovation evidently is an extension of the [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) sense ‘youngest child’, and requires no further comment.  The last two innovated meanings are best treated together, as they appear to reflect a broader symbolism of directionality.  



Terms for the cardinal directions cannot be reconstructed for any early Austronesian proto-language, but the symbolic association of &ast;_udehi_ with the west is understandable through the sense ‘later; the future’.  In many Austronesian-speaking societies (and, indeed, many traditional societies in general) the east is associated with life and the west with death, a transparent symbolism deriving from the daily course of the sun.  If [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_ma-udehi_ was used in the sense of ‘west’ it seems likely that this usage was figurative or symbolic (in some ritual sense) rather than literal, given the other, more basic senses of the term.  The cultural context of such symbolism remains unclear.  



Finally, the semantic evolution from ‘behind, later’ to ‘outside’ in a number of languages is puzzling, and can be compared to the development &ast;_babaw_ ‘above’ to ‘outside’ in other languages.  Paths of semantic change such as these suggest that the underlying system of spatial relations in Austronesian languages is fundamentally different from that in Indo-European languages, even though one-to-one category matches such as &ast;_babaw_ = ‘above’ can easily be made (cf. [Blust (1997)](Source#cldf:blust1997)).",blust1997

In some communities it is possible that a word still exists for this referent, but due to the influence of major world religions (Islam, Christianity) there is a reluctance to acknowledge that such a cultural practice once existed, or even to speak about it. Some Bornean reflexes suggest that &ast;_uduq_ referred both to a carved wooden figure set up outside a village to ensure supernatural protection, and to a ceremonial dance mask, but this is not confirmed by any witness outside Borneo.  In addition, all known reflexes in Borneo show a lowered last-syllable vowel which is irregular, and may reflect a pattern of borrowing.

The syntax and semantics of these reflexes differs significantly across languages, in some cases across closely related languages (e.g. [Hiligaynon](LanguageTable#cldf:623), where _-um-_ is described as ""a verbal affix designating completed action"", and [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423), where _-um-_ marks the actor focus of certain transitive verbs, intransitive verbs that refer to natural actions in topicless sentences, and inchoatives).  


These differences of meaning are most sharply marked by the boundary between [Formosan](LanguageTable#cldf:20004) and [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) languages.  In the former reflexes of &ast;_-um-_ mark actor focus with no widely-shared semantic restrictions defining verb classes, and no competition with other affixes marking the same syntactic relations.  In [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) languages, on the other hand, reflexes of &ast;_-um-_ compete with reflexes of [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_maŋ-_, and to some extent &ast;_maR-_ as markers of actor focus relationships.  As a result there are restrictions on the type of verb to which a reflex of &ast;_-um-_ may attach, and some of these are widely shared within [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094).

[PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_luCuŋ_ clearly referred to the Formosan rock monkey, the only species of monkey on the island, leaving &ast;_uŋay_ without a clear referent.  Since [Puyuma](LanguageTable#cldf:386) has reflexes of both terms, and distinguishes _uŋay_ as a monkey killed at an annual (headhunting) festival, it seems likely that some such distinction between the ordinary term for the animal and a ritual term for monkeys that perhaps were ritually sacrificed in connection with headhunting was made in [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072).  The initial palatal glide in [Atayal](LanguageTable#cldf:493) and [Taokas](LanguageTable#cldf:19210) is initially puzzling, but many [Taokas](LanguageTable#cldf:19210) nouns have a non-etymological _y-_ or _yV-_ (usually _ya-_), as in _yabali_ < &ast;_bali_ ‘wind’, yabatu < &ast;_batu_ ‘stone’, yatiat < &ast;_tiaN_ ‘belly, abdomen’, or _yautat_ ~ _yottat_ < &ast;_quzaN_ ‘rain’, and this may have been an article.

Much of this distribution appears to be a product of borrowing from [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326), and it is possible that the comparison should be discarded.

[PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) &ast;_ka-_ may have distinguished right/left hand from right/left side/direction, but the function of this minimally productive affix remains unclear.

28761,*waŋka,w,canoe,"Based on the comparison [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285) _waŋkaŋ_ ‘ship’, [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) _waŋkaŋ_ ‘Chinese junk’, [Fijian](LanguageTable#cldf:266) _waŋga_ ‘canoe’, [Tongan](LanguageTable#cldf:434), [Futunan](LanguageTable#cldf:607) _vaka_, [Samoan](LanguageTable#cldf:401) _vaʔa_ ‘canoe’ [Dempwolff (1934-38)](Source#cldf:dempwolff193438) reconstructed &ast;_waŋkaŋ_ ‘water vehicle, ship, canoe’.  This long accepted etymology actually is highly problematic.  


First, reflexes with a final nasal are known in only five languages, and in each case these refer specifically to Chinese junks: [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577) _waŋkaŋ_ ‘Chinese junk’, _tanah waŋkaŋ_ ‘China’; [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) _waŋkaŋ_ ‘Chinese ocean-going junk’, _limau waŋkaŋ_ ‘imported Chinese oranges’; [Acehnese](LanguageTable#cldf:225), [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285), [Makassarese](LanguageTable#cldf:325) _waŋkaŋ_ ‘Chinese junk (boat)’.  


Second, neither the [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) nor the [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285) words can regularly reflect &ast;_waŋkaŋ_, since &ast;_w-_ disappeared in [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) and &ast;_wa-_ became [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285) _o_.  


Moreover, the word in [Ngaju Dayak](LanguageTable#cldf:18577), which is spoken in the interior river systems of Southeast Borneo, clearly is a loan from the coastal [Banjarese](LanguageTable#cldf:243).  It appears likely, then, that _waŋkaŋ_ is a loan from some southern form of Chinese (Fukienese?  Hakka?)  which was borrowed into [Malay](LanguageTable#cldf:326) and [Javanese](LanguageTable#cldf:285).


In apparent contradiction to this conclusion are reflexes in [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076), [South Halmahera-West New Guinea](LanguageTable#cldf:20002), and especially [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) languages, where the probability of early borrowing from Chinese is all but non-existent.  Since most [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) languages have lost original final consonants, many [OC](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) reflexes could derive from &ast;_waŋkaŋ_.  In those languages which normally preserve the final consonant, however, no final consonant is found in this word ([Dobuan](LanguageTable#cldf:258), [Roviana](LanguageTable#cldf:396)), thus supporting &ast;_waŋka_, not &ast;_waŋkaŋ_. [Doran (1981)](Source#cldf:doran1981) has chosen this form as the title of a book on Austronesian canoe origins, but he combines a genuine [Oceanic](LanguageTable#cldf:19082) cognate set with such non-cognate [WMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19094) forms as [Tagalog](LanguageTable#cldf:423) _baŋkaʔ_ ‘boat’, [Malagasy](LanguageTable#cldf:18432) _lakana_ (Prov. _laka_) ‘canoe’. 


 It is now simplest to conclude that &ast;_waŋka_ was an innovation which appeared in northeastern Indonesia prior to the separation of the [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076) and [EMP](LanguageTable#cldf:20001) language groups from one another, but after the separation of [PCEMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19074) from all other Austronesian languages.  Under this interpretation, the similarity of the native term &ast;_waŋka_ to the apparent loanword _waŋkaŋ_ must be considered a remarkable coincidence.  Under this interpretation, [Mongondow](LanguageTable#cldf:245) _waŋga_ (for expected &ast;&ast;_waŋka_) ‘boat’ is best regarded as a loan from some still undetermined [CMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19076) source.",dempwolff193438;doran1981

As noted in [Blust (1985)](Source#cldf:blust1985) the [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) generic term for ‘vine’ contradicts certain proposed universal evolutionary sequences in [Brown (1984)](Source#cldf:brown1984).  In private correspondence Brown has maintained that &ast;_waRej_ probably meant ‘tying material’.  There is, however, no empirical basis for Brown's conclusion.  [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_waRej_ clearly contrasts with [PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_talih_ ‘rope, string, cordage’, and the semantic contrast is maintained in some attested languages, as [Nauna](LanguageTable#cldf:355) (Admiralties), where _way_ means either ‘vine’ or ‘rope’, but _tɨl_ (< &ast;_talih_) means only ‘rope’ (never ‘vine’).  


The semantic extensions to ‘rope’, ‘snake’ ([PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_nipay_) and ‘vein, tendon’ ([PMP](LanguageTable#cldf:19081) &ast;_uRat_) are all easily understood as modifications of an original meaning ‘vine’. Examples of the transfer of a term for a raw material to some useful product made from it are cited in [Blust (1985)](Source#cldf:blust1985).  The English word ‘rope’ is not only applied to vines, but is extended to veins and tendons in New Guinea Pidgin, and in Borneo and Sumatra the word for ‘vine’ is often used as a benign substitute for ‘snake’ when one is exposed to the danger of snakes in the jungle.  Significantly, reflexes of &ast;_talih_ rarely mean ‘vine’, and never mean ‘snake’.",blust1985;brown1984;blust1985

Adopting this interpretation requires the assumption that Sanskrit _yawa_ ‘barley’ was borrowed as pre-Javanese _jawa_ ‘millet’ within the past two millennia, as the early Indian name for Java was Yawadwipa, presumably because millet was widely cultivated on Java at that time (barley is not a native Southeast Asian crop --- see the doubts expressed in the gloss of Old Javanese jawa).  


This putative loanword then spread northward with substitution of _d_ for _j_ in languages that lacked palatals, presumably replacing whatever term applied to the type of millet that this word represented.  One possible scenario, then, is that _jawa_ > _dawa_ replaced reflexes of &ast;_beCeŋ_ ‘foxtail millet: _Setaria italica_’.  However, the specific application of reflexes of &ast;_zawa_ to foxtail millet in southern Taiwan and much of the central Philippines (but not in intervening areas) argues against this interpretation and in favor of &ast;_zawa_ as a [PAn](LanguageTable#cldf:19072) term that has been lost over wide areas but retained in scattered pockets in its original meaning.  Various references ([Aklanon](LanguageTable#cldf:226), [Cebuano](LanguageTable#cldf:252), [Agutaynen](LanguageTable#cldf:19189), [Yakan](LanguageTable#cldf:1129), [Iban](LanguageTable#cldf:276)) suggest that millet was secondary to rice as a daily staple in virtually all language groups, a factor that may have played a role in the far more robust attestation for terms like &ast;_pajay_ or &ast;_beRas_ as compared with &ast;_beCeŋ_, or &ast;_zawa_.",buck1949[513]

The comparison given here supports the first of these reconstructions as *gawaq rather than *gawa, except that Iban shows final glottal stop for expected -_h_. The second appears here as PWMP *gaway ‘religious feast, festivity’. Complicating the picture are western Indonesian forms such as Sundanese _gawe_ ‘work, business’, _pa-gawe _‘worker’, Old Javanese _gaway ~ gawe_ ‘work, task, occupation; work, product; feast, celebration; use, purpose’, Balinese _gawe _‘to do, make, work’, and Sasak gawe ‘work, performance’ which suggest that *gaway may be an affixed form of *gawaq.",
