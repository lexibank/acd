30628 *zauq

One reconstructions and the comment are missing:
--
PMP     *zauq zauq (gloss uncertain)

WMP
Old Javanese	doh doh	at a distance, far away
8107

POC     *sauq sauq (gloss uncertain)

OC
Seimat	xau-xau-an	far
Takia	a-sau-sau	very far
Motu	dau-dau	distant; to be distant (of place or time)
--

NOTE:   Also Toba Batak dao ‘far, distant’. This morpheme appears to have replaced PAn *dawiN ‘far, distant’ in PMP. Favorlang/Babuza ro, ma-ro is a superficially similar form that, if accepted, would establish both *zauq and *dawiN as PAn, and raise fundamental questions about homonymy. However, the Favorlang/Babuza reflex of PAn *z is clearly t in etymologies such as *zalan > tarran ‘road’, and *quzaN > utas ‘rain’, and it therefore seems best to treat the similarity of Favorlang/Babuza ro, ma-ro to such non-Formosan forms as Lawangan oroʔ, Mambai ro or Waiyewa ma-ro as a product of chance convergence.

30863 *Rabun

missing description:

Note:   Also Manobo (Western Bukidnon) gapun ‘a cloud’, peŋ-gapun ‘(of the sky) to become cloudy’, Ngaju Dayak hawon ‘sky, heavens’, Toba Batak rambon 'unclear, hazy, indistinct, Motu γahu ‘mist; fog at sea; haze’. The gloss ‘cloud’ in some languages seems too generalized to be useful, since *Rabun evidently referred only to clouds that hung low over the tops or sides of mountains --- in other words, to those that obscured landscape features through an intervening mist or fog, not to clouds high in the sky. Dempwolff included Malay rambon ‘hail’, but no such form is cited in Wilkinson, and its connection with the present comparison remains in doubt.

27866 *qulun₂
missing subset and comment

POC     *quluŋ-an rest the head on; wooden headrest

OC
Titan	ul-uluŋ	pillow
Seimat	ul-uluŋ	rest the head
Bugotu	uluŋ-a	a pillow; to pillow the head
Nggela	uluŋ-a	rest one's head on; a headrest of wood, pillow (modern)
Sa'a	uluŋ-e	to pillow, to serve as a pillow
Ulawa	uluŋ-a	to pillow, to serve as a pillow
Pohnpeian	ul-uhl	pillow; small hill; use a pillow
 	uluŋ	use a pillow (trans.)
Chuukese	wúún	pillow, headrest
 	wúnna-n	his pillow
Puluwat	wúlúŋ	possessive classifier for pillows
 	wúlúúl	pillow
Mota	uluŋ-a	pillow
Niue	uluŋ-a	pillow, headrest
Tuvaluan	uluŋ-a	pillow
Nukuoro	uluŋ-a	pillow; lie with one's head on a pillow
Rennellese	ʔuguŋ-a	wooden headrest; pillow (it was taboo to sit on either headrest or pillow even in 1972)
Maori	uruŋ-a	pillow
Hawaiian	uluna	pillow, cushion, formerly made of pandanus

Note:   Also Lau uruŋa ‘wooden prop for the head, pillow (modern); to prop the head’, Mota iliŋa ‘headrest or pillow; to rest the head’, Kapingamarangi uluŋi ‘pillow; cushion one's head on, lean on’. The similarity of the WMP and OC forms was noted by Milke (1968) who, however, did not comment on the irregular correspondence of the stem-final nasals. Alternatively we could reconstruct WMP *qulun/qulun-an, POc *quluŋa, and treat the two sets as unrelated. Given their detailed agreement in every respect apart from the discrepant nasals this does not appear to be the optimal solution, and is rejected here despite the resulting irregularity. It is possible that both *qulun and *quluŋ-an contain *qulu ‘head’, but if so the morphology remains obscure.
